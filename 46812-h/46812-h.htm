<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>A title of convenient length, but one which
shall exactly fit the subject-matter in hand,
is a desideratum that seldom lies within an author's
reach. The title selected for this book is open to
the objection that, though consisting of as many as
six words, it is, however, not quite explicit. The
sense in which the word "police" is used is explained
in the Introductory Chapter, but it here
remains to be said that "England" must be taken to
include the Principality of Wales, and, incidentally,
that by the employment of the indefinite article an
indication of the non-pretentious character of the
work is intended.</p>

<p>References have been but sparingly given throughout,
and, in answer to those critics who may possibly
object that the array of authorities quoted is too
meagre, the author can only plead in extenuation
that opportunities for taking full advantage of good
reference libraries are often denied to dwellers in
camps and barracks. In general the plan adopted,
or at least aimed at, has been to refer to all Acts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>Parliament mentioned in the text, to acknowledge
the source of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbatim</i> quotations, and to give the
authority relied on in support of any statement that
may reasonably be held to verge on contentious, or
even on debatable, ground.</p>

<p>In amplification of the Criminal Statistics tabulated
on page 337, and in confirmation of the
deductions there drawn, an encouraging fact may
be mentioned. Although the Census Returns for
1901 shew that the population of England and
Wales now exceeds thirty-two and a half millions,
the Judicial Statistics recently published by the
Home Office state that the number of persons
brought to trial before the superior criminal courts
during 1899 (the last year for which such statistics
are available) was under eleven thousand, which is
the lowest figure yet recorded.</p>

<p>Before concluding these prefatory remarks I must
express my thanks to Lord Alverstone, who has
been kind enough to find time to look through
my proof-sheets and to allow me to dedicate the
book to him; to H. W. Carless Davis, Esq., of All
Souls' College, Oxford, who has so generously
brought an expert knowledge of Anglo-Saxon
history to bear upon my earlier chapters, and to
those Chief Constables and other officials who have
helped me with information and advice. In particular
must I acknowledge my indebtedness to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>D. W. Rannie, Esq., of Oriel College, Oxford, for it
is not too much to say that without his invaluable
assistance and encouragement the following pages
would never have appeared.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER</h2>


<p>Introducing himself to his readers at the
close of the eighteenth century, Dr Colquhoun
wrote: "Police in this country may be considered
as a new science." A full generation later, or to be
more precise, in the year of Queen Victoria's accession,
one of the leading magazines of the day found
occasion to remark as follows: "The art of preventing
offences is unbeaten ground&mdash;has hardly had a
scientific teacher. On laws and general legislation,
on the theory of crimes and punishments, on prison
discipline, on the execution of offenders, and all the
ulterior proceedings of delinquency, we have treatises
without number; but on the institutions of police we
have not a single work, except perhaps the matter-of-fact
publication of the late Dr Colquhoun."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Since this paragraph was first printed a period of
unparalleled literary activity has been witnessed, a
period so prolific of book-making that the thirty-nine
miles of shelves with which the main building
of the British Museum is furnished have not
sufficed to contain the ever-increasing accumulation
of volumes that must be housed. It is true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>that in modern melodrama the detective has been
found an almost indispensable property, nor has he
been altogether neglected by the modern novelist;
there are scores of blue-books containing evidence
collected by Parliamentary Committees on the subject
of police, and there is no lack of excellent manuals
wherein the constable's duty is defined and explained;
but at the dawn of the twentieth century, and in spite
of the over-crowded state of our public libraries, we
are still waiting for the advent of the teacher who
will investigate and expound for us the police
sciences.</p>

<p>In the following pages some attempt will be made
to approach this strangely neglected subject, not
indeed by the avenue that a scientist would use, but
simply to trace in outline the story of English police,
keeping in view the underlying principles that have
directed, as well as those political and other considerations
that have controlled, its evolution. Previous
neglect is not however the only reason why
the institution of police calls for historical treatment.
On three other grounds in particular can the subject
claim recognition; it deserves notice on account of
its interest, on account of its antiquity, and on account
of its importance.</p>

<p>The history of any national institution should not
be totally devoid of interest; and amongst all our
institutions it would be hard to find one so eminently
characteristic of our race, both in its origin and in its
development, or one so little modified by foreign
influences, as the combination of arrangements for
maintaining the peace, which we call "police." Police
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>questions touch each one of us so intimately in our
daily life, in our personal liberty and in our self-respect;
the character of a nation is so profoundly
influenced by the nature of the control to which it is
subjected, that a due appreciation of the scope of
police functions, a proper knowledge of the origin
and extent of the powers and duties delegated to
our constabulary forces, must possess a more than
academic interest. Continental gendarmeries, framed
for the most part on the Latin model, have been imposed&mdash;often
ready-made&mdash;on various nationalities,
without heed to their racial peculiarities, and careless
of local tradition or circumstance. Our English
police system, on the other hand, rests on foundations
designed with the full approval of the people,
we know not how many hundreds of years before
the Norman conquest, and has been slowly moulded
by the careful hand of experience, developing as a
rule along the line of least resistance, now in advance
of the general intelligence of the country, now lagging
far behind, but always in the long run adjusting itself
to the popular temper, always consistent with local
self-government, and even at its worst, always English.</p>

<p>When a people emerges from the savage state its
first care is the institution of some form of civil
government. To this there is no exception, it is, in
the words of Macaulay, "as universal as the practice
of cookery." Martial law may co-exist with, and at
times obscure, the civil machinery; but depending
essentially, as it does, on local and temporary causes,
must in the end inevitably be superseded, and whenever
there arises a conflict between the two, the civil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>administration will invariably outstay the other by
virtue of the inertia of its everlasting necessity. The
penal department of any form of civil government
must principally consist of two closely allied branches,
the judiciary that interprets the law and exacts penalties
for its infraction, and the police whose duty it is
to enforce the legal code as laid down by the judges,
it being in the nature of things that judicial functions
cannot exist independently of police functions. Webster
defines "police" as "the organized body of civil
officers in a city, town or district, whose particular
duties are the preservation of good order, the prevention
and detection of crime, and the enforcement of
the laws." Blackstone goes further when he says
that "the public police and economy" must be considered
as "the due regulation and domestic order of
the kingdom, whereby the individuals of the State,
like members of a well-governed family, are bound
to conform to the rules of propriety, good neighbourhood
and good manners, to be decent, industrious
and inoffensive in their respective stations." As used
in this book, the term "police" approximates to the
definitions of both these authorities; in general
merely a synonym for "constabulary," it also embraces
all the various expedients employed by society
to induce its members to acquiesce in the arrangements
that tend to promote public security, including
such measures as the compulsory education of children,
the reformation of criminals, the observance of
sanitary and hygienic conditions, the control of the
liquor traffic, and the prevention of cruelty to children
and animals. In this latter sense the object of police
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>is not only to enforce compliance with the definite
law of the land, but also to encourage a general
recognition of the unwritten code of manners which
makes for social progress and good citizenship.</p>

<p>Police, therefore, occupies a position of vital importance
in the commonwealth; it is not too much
to assert that the restraining influence exerted by a
good police system is as necessary to the welfare of
society as are self-imposed moral and physical restraints
to the health of the individual. To the
superior judges fall the duties of solving abstruse
legal problems, and of determining the weightiest
legal issues, but it is the police magistrate who is in
daily contact with the criminal and with the aggrieved
person, it is he who applies the law in the first
instance, and to him the large majority of the people
look for decisions upon which their liberty or their
property may depend. "There is scarcely a conceivable
case," said a London magistrate in 1834,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
"arising particularly among the lower orders, which
may not immediately or indirectly come under the
notice of the Police Offices. It is most important,
therefore, that every means should be adopted for
upholding their reputation, and so extending and
increasing their moral influence." Only second in
importance to the magistracy comes the constabulary,
"the primary constitutional force for the protection
of individuals in the enjoyment of their legal rights,"<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
designed to stand between the powerful and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>weak, to prevent oppression, disaster and crime, and
to represent the cause of law and order at all times
and in all places. In every court and alley the
policeman stands for good citizenship, he is a reality
that the most ignorant can comprehend, and upon
his impartiality, efficiency, and intelligence depends
the estimation in which the law is held by the
masses.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that this country is well policed,
and fortunately for us, there is equally no doubt
that we are not over-policed. However numerous
and outrageous may be the theoretical imperfections
of our method for maintaining the peace, its practical
superior has yet to be discovered. A police system
does not only need to be efficient, it must be popular;
that is to say, it must conduct its operations with so
scrupulous a regard to the susceptibilities of the
people that public sympathy and approval are not
alienated. The problem of devising an engine of
sufficient power and mechanical ability to compel
subjection to a rigid standard of uniformity is not a
matter of great difficulty, but there is little credit
and no comfort in the indiscriminate tyranny of
a Juggernaut that mangles its suicidal votaries.
Government cannot be exercised without coercion,
but the coercion employed ought to be reduced to
the lowest possible limit consistent with safety, the
ideal police force being the one which affords a
maximum of protection at the cost of a minimum of
interference with the lawful liberty of the subject.
The real difficulty of the police problem is therefore
to fix the limits where non-interference should end,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>and where coercion should begin. Mill enunciated
the maxim that "all restraint qua restraint is an
evil," and Bentham taught that only those preventive
measures are sound the application of which involves
no injury to the innocent; but there is one limit
which cannot be disregarded if police is to be a
blessing rather than a curse, and that is, that the
plan adopted for the prevention of crime must never
become more intolerable than the effect of the crime
itself.</p>

<p>English police, however, is not the creation of any
theorist nor the product of any speculative school, it
is the child of centuries of conflict and experiment.
Simple pecuniary compensation to the injured, sumptuary
laws for the removal of temptation, torture in
lieu of legal process, the payment of blood-money
to informers, martial law enforced by puritan zealots,
an amateur constabulary spasmodically supported by
soldiery, the wholesale execution or banishment of
offenders, these and many other expedients have all
in their turn been grafted on the parent stock, tried,
and found wanting. Are our present methods for
the maintenance of the peace, for the suppression of
crime, and for the encouragement of social virtue,
perfect or nearly so? We can hardly suppose that
posterity will answer these questions in the affirmative,
but we can at least congratulate ourselves that
the people of England, no longer living under a
barbarous criminal code, enjoy to-day no small
measure of security for their property and persons,
without having to submit to a host of meddlesome
restrictions and unreasonable formalities.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>ANGLO-SAXON AND NORMAN POLICE</small></h2>


<p>In the days before the attainment of English unity,
the maintenance of the peace was the care of
certain local institutions and bodies, the nature of
which need not here be specified. The Anglo-Saxon
period of our history being one of continual
change and gradual development, the maintenance
of the peace cannot be treated as a homogeneous
whole before the various arrangements which secured
it had been consolidated, and, for the first time
reduced to a system, by Edgar. From this time
onwards, however, the whole of the now united
England may be said to have enjoyed a general
guarantee for public order under the name of the
"King's Peace," so called because the king guaranteed,
or at least promised, to his subjects, a state of peace
and security in return for the allegiance which he
demanded from them.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>As "the highest maintainer of the peace," the
king claimed an actual police supremacy, and was
not content with a mere title. Moreover, by virtue
of his position as Commander-in-Chief, he had the
power of enforcing compliance with the rules of the
peace, of which he was the chief guardian and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>exponent. An English king was not only the
hereditary ruler of his people, he was their chosen
chief magistrate also. The idea that the peace and
orderliness of the kingdom intimately depended
upon the personality of its ruler was so deeply
rooted that, at his death, the "King's Peace" was
held to have lapsed, and, on their accession, English
sovereigns were wont to make proclamation afresh
of "general peace orders," an example which was
followed by William the Conqueror and his successors.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Referring to the death of Henry I., a
chronicler writes: "The king died on the following
day after St Andrew's mass day, in Normandy, then
there was tribulation in the land, for every man that
could, forthwith robbed another ... a good man he
was, and there was great awe of him. No man
durst misdo against another in his time. He made
peace for man and beast."<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The King's Peace was of two kinds: there was
the public peace of the realm, common to all men;
and there was the private peace proper to the king
himself, designed to safeguard his person, to uphold
his dignity, and to secure his interests in every way.
This royal peace, as it may be called, was especially
concerned with certain places, seasons, and individuals;
a special measure of protection was accordingly
extended to the king and his nobles, to nuns,
widows and clergy; whilst breaches of the peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>which occurred on Coronation days, on Fast days,
and the like, or which were committed in the
vicinity of the royal palaces or upon the "King's
Highway," received exemplary punishment from
the royal judges. The public peace, on the other
hand, afforded protection to all alike, to the exclusion
only of the "unfrith," as those men were
called whose crimes placed them without the pale
of society, or who, holding no land, yet failed to
enrol themselves in a "tything."</p>

<p>The police system which, under the king, maintained
the peace was partly organised on the basis
of land tenure. As in the Sudan to-day the Omdah
is held responsible for the robberies committed in his
district, and as in China the head of a family may
legally be called upon to answer for the transgressions
of his kinsfolk, so King Alfred looked to the
thane<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to produce the culprit or satisfy the claim.
The plan adopted counted on the assistance of self-interest
for its complete success; the thane being a
landed proprietor and consequently unable to dispose
of his property secretly, was security to the king for
all the members of his household&mdash;if any of them
broke the law, his over-lord the thane was careful to
bring him to justice. Yet poverty brought no exemption
to the landless freeman. He too had to find a
guarantee for his good behaviour; if he was unable
to attach himself to some thane, he was compelled to
combine with others in the same position as himself,
in order that their joint goods or aggregate credit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>should provide sufficient bail for the shortcomings of
any member of the society: the penalty incurred by
those who could not, or would not, thus find the
required security was that they were forbidden to
possess cattle, and were no longer under the protection
of the law. Freemen, therefore, who had no
freehold, banded themselves together into "tythings":
a tything consisted of the inhabitants of ten homesteads,
and the members elected one of their number
to be their "headborough,"<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who thus became their
representative, and was responsible for the community.</p>

<p>The police organisation which we are considering
is generally spoken of as the "Frankpledge system,"
frankpledge signifying the guarantee for peace maintenance
demanded by the king from all free Englishmen,
the essential properties of this responsibility
being, that it should be local, and that it should be
mutual. As we trace the history of police in England
we shall see that these two qualities have survived
through the successive stages of its evolution, and
seem to be inseparable from our national conception
of police functions.</p>

<p>The development of this system led to the institution
of the Hundred,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which, as its name implies, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>a group of ten tythings, under a responsible head.
Hundreds as well as tythings had definite police
functions to perform: when a crime was committed,
information had to be at once given to the hundred-men
and tythingmen of the district, and it was their
duty to pursue, arrest, and bring to justice all peace-breakers.
In the event of the non-appearance of a
culprit at the court of justice to which he was
summoned, his nine fellow-pledges were allowed one
month in which to produce him, when, if he was not
forthcoming, a fine was exacted, the liability falling,
in the first place, on any property of the fugitive that
might be available, in the second place, on the tything,
and,&mdash;should both these sources prove insufficient
to satisfy the claim,&mdash;on the Hundred.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Furthermore
the headboroughs were required to purge
themselves on oath, that they were not privy to the
flight of the offender, and to swear that they would
bring him to justice if possible. On the other hand,
if any member of a tything was imprisoned for an
offence, it was not customary to release him without
the consent of his fellow-pledges, even though the
fine had been paid.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The practice of levying police fines from hundreds
and tythings was an old one, and the limits of its
application were clearly defined by Edgar: "and
let every man so order that he have a surety,
and let the surety then bring and hold him to
every justice: and if anyone do wrong and run
away, let the surety bear that which he ought to
bear. But if it be a thief, and if he can get hold
of him within twelve months, let him deliver him
up to justice, and let be rendered unto him what
he before has paid."<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The fines<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that were exacted, called respectively
<span xml:lang="ang" lang="ang">fightwitt</span>, <span xml:lang="ang" lang="ang">grithbryce</span>, and <span xml:lang="ang" lang="ang">frithbrec</span>, differed in
character, and varied in amount. When several
persons had participated in a common crime the
fine was payable by all who had a hand in it; an
infraction of the peace by seven associates constituted
a riot, and if thirty-five persons were
concerned, the breach amounted to a rebellion.</p>

<p>Distinct from the official police societies, created
by the central government for the general security,
there also existed certain private and voluntary
associations called peace-guilds, entered into by the
inhabitants of London and other towns for their own
protection. Each guild consisted of members
arranged in ten groups under ten headmen, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>of whom acted as chief of the guild and treasurer,
the remainder forming a kind of consulting committee
to discuss and advise upon the various
interests of the associations at their monthly
gatherings. The object of these guilds was simply
mutual assurance, and each member had to pay
fourpence to a common fund, out of which subscribers
were compensated for any loss they might
sustain through theft, the treasurer being authorised
further to contribute a sum not exceeding one
shilling towards the apprehension of delinquents.</p>

<p>The military and police systems were closely
allied: the national militia was organised in tythings
and hundreds, and had a place to fill in the complete
design of peace maintenance; its embodiment was
not only resorted to in time of war, it was also liable
to be called out by "summons of the array" if
disturbances were feared, or even for the pursuit of
a single fugitive from justice, but its members could
not be called upon to serve beyond the limits of
their respective shires except to repel invasion.
Every free Englishman between the ages of fifteen
and sixty (the clergy and infirm only excepted)
was liable to be called upon to perform three public
services<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> for the peace of the commonwealth; he
was bound to assist in repelling invasions, in crushing
rebellions, and in suppressing riots. The Sheriffs
therefore who were responsible for the conservancy
of the peace in the hundreds were enabled to muster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse comitatus</i>, or whole available police force
of the shire, in case of emergency. All men went
armed in those days, and since the members of a
tything were obliged on the summons of a headborough
to join in the pursuit, the cry of "Stop
thief" was a formidable weapon in the hands of
the local executive.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon conception of police functions
is thus clearly intelligible: the internal peace of the
country was held by them to be of the first importance,
and every free man had to bear his part in
maintaining it; theoretically all men were policemen,
and it was only for the sake of convenience that the
headborough (or tythingman as he came to be more
generally called) answered for those of his neighbours,
on whom he had to rely in case of necessity. The
word "peace" was used in its widest possible meaning,
and a breach of the peace was understood to
include all crimes, disorders, and even public nuisances.
The principle on which the police system
was based was primarily preventive. "The conservancy
of the peace," says Lambard, "standeth in
three things: that is to say, first, in foreseeing that
nothing be done that tendeth either directly or by
means to the breach of the peace; secondly, in
quieting and pacifying those that are occupied in the
breach of the peace; and thirdly, in punishing such
as have already broken the peace." Our Saxon
ancestors did not spend much time in "quieting" or
"pacifying"&mdash;a lawbreaker was at war with the
community and received no quarter&mdash;but in other
respects Lambard's definition applies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>It was assumed that all but a small minority of
the king's subjects were, to use a modern phrase&mdash;good
citizens&mdash;and personally interested in keeping
the king's peace inviolate; and that they might therefore
safely be trusted to do everything in their power
to preserve it, without any necessity arising for the
use of coercion. Had all men been equally trustworthy
in this respect no police measures would have
been required and none devised; but there existed on
the fringe of Anglo-Saxon society, as will occur with
all societies, a certain number of delinquents perpetually
on the look-out for opportunities of preying
on their fellows, and the decennary system of police,
as it may be called, was an attempt to hold in check
this lawless minority without having to raise and
permanently support an expensive or elaborate force
for its suppression.</p>

<p>The design was to group all honest men into convenient
companies, excluding therefrom and from the
benefits that civil government could then confer, not
only those men who were living in open defiance of
the rules laid down by society for its protection, but
those men also, whose reputation for honesty and fair
dealing did not stand high enough in the estimation
of their neighbours to induce a sufficient number to
accept a share of responsibility for their defaults. By
this means a fence was set up which divided with a
fair degree of accuracy the law-breaking section of
society from the law-abiding, the problem of peace-maintenance
being much simplified thereby; it was
not the declared enemy nor the recognised outcast
that was feared; the former might be met with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>superior force, and the latter could be kept down
like vermin, it was the danger of the wolf within the
fold that alarmed our ancestors. The dread of secret
crime is a deeply-seated national characteristic, and
accounts for the savage treatment served out to
witches and Egyptians (as gypsies used to be
called) through the middle ages and almost up to
our own times. Alfred the Great reflected this
feeling when he drew a distinction between cutting
down a neighbour's tree with an axe and burning
it with fire, the latter offence being declared the
more heinous of the two, not as one might suppose,
because of the danger of the fire spreading to other
trees, but because of the clandestine character of the
deed, it being open to the offender if detected to
declare the burning to be accidental, a plea that he
could not advance if the axe was used.</p>

<p>A detected criminal was either fined, mutilated, or
killed, but punishment, as we now understand the
term, was seldom inflicted; that is to say, the dominant
idea was neither to reform the culprit nor to deter
others from following in his footsteps. If a man was
killed it was either to satisfy the blood-feud or to
remove him out of the way as a wild beast would be
destroyed; if a man was mutilated by having his
forefinger cut off, or branded with a red-hot iron on
the brow, it was done, not so much to give him pain,
as to make him less expert in his trade of thieving,
and to put upon him an indelible mark by which all
men should know that he was no longer a man to be
trusted; if fines were levied, it was more with a view
to the satisfaction of the recipients of the money or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>cattle or what not, than with the intention of causing
discomfort or loss to the offender.</p>

<p>The distinction that we now make between remedial
and legal justice was theoretically held by the Anglo-Saxons,
that is to say, repayment in money or kind
for a civil offence, and death or some less punishment
for an offence against the criminal code was
recognised in their penal administration; but at the
same time fines to expiate criminal injuries were
also allowed, both in the shape of amercements
to the Crown and of compensation to the injured.
Homicides rendered themselves liable to a triple
penalty, which, it appears, was the same whether
the killing was wilful or whether it was accidental&mdash;one
third part, called "Maegbote," being assigned
to the next-of-kin to compensate him for the death
of a relative; a second portion, or "Manbote," reconciling
the thane to the loss of his vassal; and the
remaining share, known as "Wite," passing to the
king on account of the violence done to his peace.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Only offences of a particularly heinous description
were "bootless" (bote-less), as those crimes for
which no compensation was permitted were called&mdash;of
such a nature were murder when committed
in a church, and the slaying of a man asleep.</p>

<p>The fines payable by the aggressor in cases where
minor personal injuries had been inflicted were carefully
graduated; thus, for a cut one inch long on
the face, the sum of two shillings had to be paid; if
the wound was underneath the hair only half that
sum was exacted; but should the victim have suf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>fered
the loss of an ear, he was compensated to the
extent of thirty shillings, and so on.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>It would offend our modern ideas of justice if
a murderer were allowed to go free on payment of a
sum of money to the relatives of his victim, still
more so if a portion of the fine went to the Sovereign;
but the practice is common amongst semi-civilised
communities, to whom the complex and
costly methods we now employ would be at once
unintelligible and impracticable.</p>

<p>When it came to a question of proof, reliance was
placed, in the absence of any surer method of discovering
the truth, upon the oath of the interested
party or parties; and just as the security of a thane
was sufficient, where that of a landless freeman had
to be supplemented by the contributions of his
neighbours, so would the oath of a man of fortune
and position prevail in cases where that of a common
man had to be fortified by the corroborating oaths of
his fellows.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>No matter what his station in life might be a man
could always strengthen his case in this way: the
more numerous the oath-helpers the greater the
value of their evidence, and this held good even if
it was clear that none of them were acquainted with
the circumstances under consideration, because it was
commonly believed that divine interference would
prevent any considerable number of persons from
perjuring themselves <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en bloc</i>. The various ordeals,
by combat, by fire, by water and many others, were
conceived in the same spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The principle of making every man responsible
for his own actions, and to some extent answerable
for the doings of his neighbour, has much to commend
it, and its application would produce an almost
ideal state of social security if its practical employment
was not marred by two inherent weaknesses;
in the first place it can only be applied with success
to an agricultural community that is content to live
always in the same spot, or whose migratory instincts
the authorities are prepared to suppress; and,
in the second place, such a system puts a premium
both on the concealment of crime, and on the commission
of perjury, since a tything had every inducement
to forswear itself in order to escape the
infliction of a fine or to save one of its members
from punishment.</p>

<p>That the system above described was effectual in
dealing with any crime that may have existed in
England at the time cannot be doubted, and Gneist,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
in his review of the period, says, "The insular position
of the country, and the pre-eminently peaceable
character of the later Anglo-Saxon times, developed
the maintenance of the peace to such a perfection,
that the chroniclers give an almost Arcadian picture
of the peacefulness and security of the land in the
time of Alfred the Great, and at some subsequent
periods." Lord Coke<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> too declares that before the
Conquest, whilst this ancient constitution remained
entire, a man might ride through England with
much money about him and run no risk of molestation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>though armed with no other weapon than a
white wand.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>If it is allowable to estimate the efficiency of a
police system by the measure of the security enjoyed
by those under its protection (nor is it easy to conceive
of a fairer or more comprehensive test), it may
then be asserted with confidence that the Anglo-Saxon
model, crude as it undoubtedly was in many respects,
compares not unfavourably with the various preventive
agencies which the wisdom of succeeding generations
has been able to produce. This comparative superiority
survived, as we shall see, until the advent of
the admirable system of police, not yet a century old,
under which we have the good fortune to live to-day.</p>

<p>After the Conquest, the national police organisation
was retained by the Normans, the headborough
becoming the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">præpositus</span>," and the joint guarantee
being known as "mutual security"; but the old
forms which had weighed lightly on the people
hitherto, were now harshly administered by the conquerors,
whose officials, unaccustomed to the system,
and indifferent to the susceptibilities of the native
population, arbitrarily exacted the police fines, and
did so in a manner that whilst proper investigation
was rare, violence was common.</p>

<p>Of these officials the worst offender was the
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">vicecomes</span>," the successor to the shire-reeve (<i>i.e.</i>
sheriff), who under the Anglo-Saxon régime had
controlled the police administration of the county.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>The <span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vicecomes</span> went on circuit each Michaelmas, to
hold an ambulatory police court, called the Court of
the Tourn, to deal with petty offences in the provinces,
to bring capital crimes to the cognisance of
the superior courts, and to make an annual revision
of the frankpledge, <i>i.e.</i> an inspection of the police
societies, with the object of ensuring that all the
tythings were full. The visit of the Norman sheriff
generally resolved itself into a demand for the payment
of heavy fines, that might, or might not, be
legally due, and which too often were heavier than
the people could bear, for whereas the English
shilling had been worth about fivepence, the
Norman shilling was equivalent to twelve pence,
and yet amercements were still calculated on the
old scale without any allowance being made for the
change in the value of the coin. Even in the rare
cases where extortion was not practised the local
character of the police administration, which had
always been one of its most prominent features, was
to a certain extent destroyed by the interference of
the alien Tourn.</p>

<p>The object of the <span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vicecomes</span> being to collect as
many fines as possible, and to return to the king
with some substantial evidence of his zeal, he was
not over particular as to details, but fined a whole
township or borough, and left the community to
settle the incidence of the burden amongst the individuals
composing it.</p>

<p>A representative and well-known example of the
harsh control that then obtained, may be instanced;
an enactment of William the Conqueror ordained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>that any hundred within whose boundaries a Norman
was found murdered, should pay forty-six marks<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
unless the murderer was delivered up within five
days; and the sheriffs threw the burden of proof of
the victim's nationality on the hundred; in other
words, the corpse was assumed to be Norman and
had to be paid as such, unless the contrary was
proved to their satisfaction; it is almost unnecessary
to add that in nine cases out of ten, acceptable proof
could not be produced in the specified period of time.</p>

<p>Another unpopular institution was that of Curfew
Bell, introduced by the Conqueror ostensibly as a
protection against fire, but in reality intended as a
check upon the Saxons, to prevent them from meeting
after dark, and discussing the shortcomings of
their oppressors, or for other political purposes.
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle gives a pathetic
account of the severity and injustice meted out by
the Normans. "<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1124. This same year after
St Andrew's Mass, and before Christmas, held Ralph
Basset and the King's thanes a 'géwitenemote' in
Leicestershire, at Huncothoe, and there hanged
more thieves than ever were known before, that is,
in a little while, four and forty men altogether: and
despoiled six men of their eyes and mutilated them.
Many true men said that there were several who
suffered very unjustly; but our Lord God Almighty,
who seeth and knoweth every secret, seeth also that
the wretched people are oppressed with all unrighteousness.
First they are bereaved of their
property and then they are slain. Full heavy year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>was this." And again, "then was corn dear, and
cheese, and butter, for there was none in the land:
wretched men starved with hunger: some lived on
alms who had been erewhile rich: some fled the
country, never was there more misery, and never
heathen acted worse than these. The earth bare
no corn, you might as well have tilled the sea, for
the land was all ruined by such deeds."</p>

<p>If we may accept this as a true version of the
condition of England and the English, it is abundantly
clear that the system of police by decennary
societies was inevitably doomed to failure after the
Conquest. The two nations, who had little in
common, who were in fact animated by bitter racial
animosity, could not combine for any common purpose;
and it is obvious that the "mutual security"
plan can only be successful amongst a community
bound together by the ties of family or friendship.</p>

<p>The sheriff's court never won the confidence of
the people, and gradually certain neighbourhoods,
or, more correctly speaking, certain lords more
favoured than the rest, obtained the royal consent
to the substitution of local police courts, under a
steward nominated by the Lord of the Manor.
These "courts of the leet" not only had the
power to "inquire of and punish all things that
may hurt or grieve the people in general, in their
health, quiet, and welfare," but were authorised to
abate or remove public nuisances.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Courts Leet became so popular, and proved so
successful, that we soon find them established, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>merely in a few privileged places, but all over
the country; before long the Sheriff's Tourn
became the exception and the Court Leet the
rule, the struggle for survival only coming to an
end when the sheriff altogether ceased to trouble
the village communities with his annual visit of
inspection.</p>

<p>The rise of the Court Leet marks an important
stage in the development of English police. The
decennary system could only be of value as long
as its strictly local character could be preserved,
and the power of interference possessed by the
<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vicecomes</span> was foreign to the national idea of
police administration. Although the creation of
the sheriff's court must only be considered as an
ill-advised and novel attempt at centralisation, and
its discontinuance a return to first principles, it was
not to be expected that the Tourn, when once
established, would be allowed to disappear until
there was an alternative institution ready and able
to take its place. On this account the appearance
of the Court Leet was well timed, for the moment
and indispensable for the future, to act as a link
between ancient principles and modern practice.</p>

<p>When Henry II. returned from the Continent in
1170 he found it necessary to investigate the complaints
that were persistently made against the
sheriffs, who were said to have been guilty of
oppression and extortion. The charges were well
founded, and the result of his inquiry was that
several were dismissed from their office, whilst a
few years later the Assize of Northampton considerably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>reduced the authority of the remainder.
In the years that follow we find evidence, over
and over again, of the abuse of their power by the
sheriffs, whose importance steadily declined in consequence;
the decay of their office was gradual at
first, but proceeded more rapidly, as we shall see,
after the institution of "Conservators of the Peace"
by Richard I. At the Council of Northampton
provision was also made for holding assizes in the
different counties of England. For this purpose
the kingdom was divided into six circuits, and three
judges, subsequently known under the title of
"justices itinerant," were assigned to each circuit.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the recent friction between the
two nationalities (now happily on the wane), and
all the evils which had accompanied it, hundreds
and tythings continued to perform their executive
functions as best they could, and not altogether
without success; but the levying of amercements,
which was essential to the system, was so liable to
abuse at the hands of royal officers, and the fines grew
so out of proportion to the offences for which they
were exacted, that advantage was very properly
taken of King John's humiliation in 1215 to insist
that they should only be enforced in future "on
oath being made by the worthy men of the district,"
and steps were taken to confine amercements to
their proper limits. By Magna Carta police fines
were henceforward to correspond in amount to the
magnitude of the crime for which they were incurred,
and might not be enforced except with
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">beneficium competentiæ</i> <i>i.e.</i> every man had a right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>to his bare living, the merchant to his merchandise,
and the villein to his agricultural implements.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>In the following reign an attempt was made to
put fresh life into the police administration that for
more than a hundred years had been deteriorating;
it was therefore ordained<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> that a view of frankpledge
should be made every Michaelmas, and
tything be kept as in the old days; the effort,
however, was not a success, and before long the
prestige of the institution was irrevocably damaged
by the relief granted to the Baronage and Clergy
by the Statute of Marlborough, which excused them
from attendance at the Court, unless they received
special orders to be present. In any case a return
to the past was impossible, the country had outgrown
the method of control that had once been
efficacious, and altered conditions had completed
the wreck of the decennary system that racial differences
had commenced. From this time onwards,
when frankpledge is spoken of, it must be understood
to mean only the general principle that was
the basis of the indigenous system; that is to say,
a recognition of the bounden responsibility of every
citizen to take his part in the duty of maintaining
peace in the state; or, in other words, the liability
that all men share to render police services when
called upon to do so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>WATCH AND WARD</small></h2>


<p>The intimate bond which linked together the
Kingly Office and the general police organisation
invested the latter with a certain concrete dignity
that was beneficial. The people were impressed by
the fact that police was the special province of the
highest personage in the land, at a time when they
were incapable of appreciating the abstract importance
of the subject. The responsibility for peace-maintenance
was in this way definitely fixed on the
one individual, who besides being best able to enforce
compliance with his commands, had also the greatest
stake in the continued preservation of the public
peace; a kingdom without order being a kingdom
in name only. This was so well recognised that,
overbearing or indifferent as too many of our English
sovereigns proved themselves, not one of them ever
repudiated this responsibility, or failed to lay claim
to be considered as the champion of order.</p>

<p>The benefits that resulted from this royal pre-eminence
were, it must be confessed, often counter-balanced
and sometimes outweighed by corresponding
disadvantages&mdash;good kings were rare&mdash;the hand
of a king who was inclined to oppress his people
became the more grievous by reason of his police
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>supremacy&mdash;whilst under a weak king the burden of
oppression grew intolerable on account of the numberless
oppressors who immediately arose to take advantage
of his supineness. The reign of Henry III.,
externally brilliant, internally miserable, is a case in
point; for fifty-six long years peace gave place to
chaos&mdash;the king robbed, and the barons plundered,
whenever and whomsoever they could&mdash;shoals of
needy foreigners invaded England&mdash;the clergy
swindled their congregations first on one pretext
then on another, and remitted the bulk of their
spoil to the pope's nominees in far-off Italy&mdash;"crimes,"
we are told, "escaped with impunity
because the ministers themselves were in confederacy
with the robbers." Men had cause to be
dissatisfied and an excuse for taking the law into
their own hands, with the result that violence from
above was answered by violence from below. The
lawlessness which followed took several forms and
infected all classes of the community&mdash;the half-starved
peasantry, hitherto patient, now scoured
the country, and regained by force a portion of
the spoil amassed at their expense by foreigners
and others who had traded on the ignorant superstitions
of the native English. The outbreak which
at first was directed against the Italian clergy soon
degenerated into a general campaign of license, until,
as we learn, "men were never secure in their houses,
and whole villages were often plundered by bands of
robbers."<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The king adopted a capricious policy
of repression, but his action, never vigorous, came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>too late to be effectual, and failed to pacify the
disturbed districts.</p>

<p>The obvious, if still unconfessed, inability of
Henry III. to cope with the disorders which infested
the realm served as a pretext to the barons
to usurp the royal functions of peace-maintenance,
and keeping the king a virtual prisoner in their
hands, they caused the so-called Mad Parliament
holden at Oxford in 1258 to create a Committee
of Reform armed with authority to formulate new
regulations for the preservation of the peace. This
committee appointed that four knights should be
chosen by the freeholders of each county with power
to inquire into and present to Parliament the police
shortcomings of their respective shires, enacting as a
further safeguard that the freeholders concerned should
annually elect a new sheriff, and that the sheriff should
be called upon to render to Parliament an account of
his stewardship on relinquishing office.</p>

<p>These regulations, which formed part of the "Provisions
of Oxford," were well conceived, and for the
moment proved extremely popular. But they left
little permanent impress on the future life of the
nation because they were fraudulently put forth by
the barons, who, as it soon appeared, were only
scheming to win the populace over to their side in
the struggle for power, and who were far more anxious
for their own aggrandisement than they were for any
object connected with the mitigation of the troubles
that afflicted the people. The whole attitude of the
nobles was so lawless, supporting, as they did, bands
of adherents to prey on each other's lands and on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>the chattels of the defenceless commonalty, that no
lasting good could be expected to follow upon their
most specious actions, their very gifts were presumptive
evidence of premeditated guilt, and their
evil disposition was a matter of common knowledge.
"Knights and Esquires," says the Dictum of Kenilworth,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
"who were robbers, if they have no land,
shall pay the half of their goods, and find sufficient
security to keep henceforth the peace of the kingdom."
Well might Hume exclaim, "Such were the
manners of the times!"</p>


<p class="mt2">The practical disappearance of the decennary
societies, followed by the failure of the Provisions
of Oxford to restore peace to the State, necessitated
the creation of some more effectual agency for the
re-establishment of good order. Such a substitute
was fortunately provided by the famous Statute of
Winchester, which was passed in the thirteenth year
of Edward I., of whom it has been said that he did
more for the preservation of the peace in the first
thirteen years of his reign than was collectively accomplished
by the thirteen monarchs next succeeding.</p>

<p>This Winchester statute is especially important
to our inquiry, because it sums up and gives permanency
to those expedients introduced in former
reigns, which were considered worthy of retention
for the protection of society; and because it presents
to us a complete picture of that police system of the
middle ages which continued with but little alteration
for more than five hundred years, and which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>even now, though greatly changed in its outward
appearance, is still the foundation upon which our
present police structure is built.</p>

<p>The Statute of Winchester is not here presented
as a brand-new system of police extemporised in
the year 1285, but rather as the definite product of
a long series of experiments all tending in the same
direction. Legislation hastily conceived seldom survives;
and however the case may stand in other lands,
or in other departments of government, every police
measure which has won a permanent place in English
history has had a gradual growth, now retarded, now
accelerated&mdash;here something removed as old fallacies
were exposed, there something added as new knowledge
was acquired. A few well-known and representative
examples of the process at this stage of its
development may be enumerated.</p>

<p>First in importance comes the "Assize of Clarendon,"
issued in 1166, which describes how notorious
and reputed felons are to be 'presented' to the
Courts of the Justices or to the sheriffs, which
commands one sheriff to assist another in the pursuit
and capture of fugitives, and which deals with
the restrictions to be enforced against the entertainers
of strangers and the harbourers of vagabonds.
The Assize of Northampton, which was issued three
years after the rebellion of 1173, prescribes severer
punishments, provides for the registration of outlaws,
and reduces the powers of sheriffs. A writ for the
conservation of the peace issued in 1233 is referred
to by Dr Stubbs in these words: "This is a valuable
illustration of the permanence of the old English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>regulations for the security of peace in the country....
The principle thus expanded is here developed
into a separate system of Watch and Ward, which
a few years later is brought into conjunction with
the Assize of Arms, and completed by Edward I.
in the Statute of Winchester, and by the assignment
of Justices of the Peace under Edward III." Finally,
Writs for enforcing Watch and Ward and the Assize
of Arms, issued in 1252 and in 1253, may be
instanced as the immediate precursors of the Statute
of Winchester.</p>

<p>Few legislative measures have stood so long or so
prominently as this Act of 1285. Its vitality has
been remarkable; we find it periodically referred to,
and its provisions re-enforced whenever an increase
of lawlessness afflicted the State, as the universal
and proper remedy to apply to all distempers of the
sort; we find it cited as the standard authority on
Watch and Ward, even in the eighteenth century,
when two Acts of Parliament<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> quote it to prove that
the protection of a district is a constitutional duty
compulsorily incumbent on its inhabitants; nor was
it until 1793, in which year a Committee of the
House of Commons appointed to inquire into the
state of the nightly watch of the city of Westminster
stated that "the Statute of Winchester
being very obsolete is a very improper regulation,"
that people began to talk of it as old-fashioned.</p>

<p>After stating that, "robberies, murders, burnings
and thefts, be more often used than heretofore," the
statute confirms the ancient responsibility of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>hundred for offences committed within its boundaries,
"so that the whole hundred, where the robbery
shall be done, with the franchises being within the
precinct of the same hundred, shall be answerable
for the robberies," and ordains that "cries shall be
made in all counties, markets, hundreds, fairs and all
other places, where great resort of people is, so that
none shall excuse himself by ignorance."</p>

<p>Another paragraph defines the law with regard to
"Watch and Ward"&mdash;the gates of walled towns are
to be shut between sunset and daybreak, men are
forbidden to live in the suburbs, except under the
guarantee of a responsible householder, and it is
enacted that in every city "from the day of the Ascension
until the day of St Michael," a watch of six
men is to be stationed at each gate: every borough
has to provide a watch of twelve persons, whilst the
number of watchmen insisted upon by law for the
protection of the smaller towns, varies from four to
six, according to the number of inhabitants in each.
Strangers must not pass the gates during the hours
of darkness, any attempting to do so are to be
arrested by the Watch, and detained until morning,
when, "if they find cause of suspicion, they shall
forthwith deliver him to the sheriff," but if no such
cause is found, "he shall go quit." The affiliated
institutions "Hue and Cry" and the "Assize of
Arms" are next considered. Both had previously
existed in some form or other, but had been allowed
to fall into disuse, so it is now laid down afresh that
in case strangers do not obey the arrest of the
Watch, "hue and cry shall be levied upon them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>and such as keep the watch shall follow with hue
and cry, with all the towns near." Sheriffs are
reminded that it is their duty to follow the cry
with the country-side, in pursuit of law-breakers:
and that if they are neglectful, a report will be made
by the constables to the judges, who will inform the
king of the default.</p>

<p>The clauses relating to the Assize of Arms command
every male between the ages of fifteen and
sixty to have harness in his house, "for to keep the
peace"; the nature of the arms to be provided
depends upon the man's rank, and on the value of
his property, and varies from "an hauberke, an
helme of iron, a sword, a knife and a horse" for a
knight, down to bows and arrows, which were the
only weapons that the poorest class had to furnish.
In each hundred two constables were appointed to
make a half-yearly inspection of arms, and "such
defaults as they may find" shall be notified through
the judges to the king, and the king "shall find
remedy therein."</p>

<p>The Assize of Arms was something more than a
mere police regulation. Sheriffs and constables were
royal officers, and the powers entrusted to them,
which included the liberty to make domiciliary visits
for the purpose of viewing the armour, together with
the general supervision they exercised over an armed
population, placed at the king's disposal a force
that could on occasion be employed for political ends
unconnected with the professed motive of the Assize,
that of peace maintenance.</p>

<p>The only other part of the statute that need now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>be noticed deals with the regulating of highways:
it is directed that roads leading from one market
town to another "shall be enlarged so that there be
neither dyke, tree nor bush whereby a man may
lurk to do hurt, within two hundred foot on the one
side and two hundred foot on the other side of the
way": this, however, is not to apply to oaks or great
trees, but if a park march with the roadway, the lord
must "minish his park the space of two hundred
foot from the highways, as before is said, or that he
make such a wall, dyke or hedge, that offenders may
not pass, nor return to do evil."</p>

<p>The declared object of the Statute of Winchester,
was, in the words of the preamble, "for to abate the
power of felons," and the highway clause is said to
have been designed against the depredations of
bands of robbers called Drawlatches and Roberdsmen,
who, concealing themselves in the thick undergrowth
by the roadside, had been a terror to
travellers for the last hundred years or more.</p>

<p>If the law could have been enforced in this
particular, so as to leave a clear two hundred feet
both sides of the road, the result would have been
admirable, but the regulation was framed on too
ambitious a scale, with the result that it was generally
disregarded, or at the best only partially carried
out, and it is extremely unlikely that many lords
minished their parks as they were ordered.</p>

<p>It was, of course, extremely difficult to give effect
to the new police system throughout England; conditions
and customs varied in different districts;
before the introduction of newspapers ideas spread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>but slowly; and people did not readily comprehend
strange institutions, nor accept them, when understood,
without protest. This was especially the
case in the north-westerly provinces; the men of
Cheshire, amongst others, were dissatisfied with the
new arrangements, and petitioned the king to relieve
them of the burden of maintaining so many peace
officers; but Edward was not to be influenced against
his judgment, by these entreaties, and answered in
an abrupt manner that he would not change the law,
nor revoke his statutes. The men of Shropshire
and Westmoreland also, who, as it appears, had
successfully evaded their obligations under the decennary
system, now took it upon themselves to
ignore the provisions of the Statute of Winchester;
with the result that some fifteen years later, on it
being brought to his notice that the regulations
which he had laid down were not being properly
carried out, the king ordained that "the same
statute be sent again into every county to be read and
proclaimed four times a year, and kept in every
particular as strictly as the great charters, upon pain
of incurring the penalties therein limited."</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice, that as early as the thirteenth
century, the police of the capital city was placed
on a different footing from that of the rest of the
kingdom, a distinction which, to some extent, has
been retained until the present day. The Statute
of Winchester did not apply to London, but in its
stead a local Act<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> was passed in the same year,
having special reference to the government of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>metropolis. From this and from other sources, a
comprehensive reconstruction might be made of the
police arrangements that controlled London at the
time of Edward I., the principal features of which
may here be briefly indicated.</p>

<p>The city was divided into twenty-four wards, and
in each ward there were six watchmen supervised
by an alderman, who was expected to acquaint
himself with the personal characters of the residents
of his ward, and was ordered to secure any malefactors
that he might find; the aldermen, therefore,
were executive as well as judicial officers, and might
have to adjudicate in the morning upon the evidence
they themselves had collected overnight.</p>

<p>In addition to the ward-watchmen there was a
separate force called the "marching watch" (the
germ of the patrols of later days), whose duty it was
to exercise a general vigilance for the maintenance
of peace in the city, and to give their assistance to
the stationary watchmen as occasion demanded.
Foreigners, who were not freemen of the city, might
not be innkeepers, and lepers were forbidden to
leave their houses under the severest penalties;
regulations were made against the rearing of oxen
or swine within the city walls, and against the
establishment of schools of arms where fencing with
the buckler was taught. By day the gates were
open, but even then care was taken to exclude
undesirable visitors, for two sergeants "skillful men
and fluent of speech" were placed at each gate to
scrutinise all those who passed in or out.</p>

<p>One hour after sunset, curfew was rung simultaneously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>from the Church of St Martin's Le Grand and
in the other parishes, the gates were then shut,
taverns were closed, and men might not go about the
streets armed till the morning, "unless he be a great
man, or other lawful person of good repute, or their
certain messengers, having their warrants to go from
one to another with lanthorn in hand."</p>

<p>The peace officers were authorised to arrest anyone
who broke these regulations, and to bring him
the following day before the Warden, Mayor, or
Aldermen of the city, for punishment; officers were
secured against all penalties for acts done in the
execution of their office, and no complaints were
permitted to be made against them with regard to
the imprisonment or punishment of offenders, "unless
it be that an officer should do so of open malice,
and for his own revenge, or for the revenge of
another that maliciously procureth the same, and not
for the keeping of the peace."</p>

<p>It will be observed that the intention both of the
Statute of Winchester and of these regulations for
the government of London is in the main a preventive
one, that whilst every care is taken to place
obstructions in the way of transgressors, and every
caution exercised to render a criminal career difficult,
we hear but little of the penalties that follow upon
detection. This tendency is in marked contrast to
the custom of subsequent legislation, which increasingly
insisted on the infliction of punishment as the
only effectual means of diminishing crime. The
earliest English police known to us, relied almost
entirely, as has already been pointed out, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>efficacy of the preventive principle. The system
inaugurated by the Statute of Winchester which took
the place of the ancient institutions, may be considered
as the connecting link between the two
extreme conceptions of police functions, between the
policy of prevention and the policy of repression.
Watch and Ward was the civil equivalent of the
sentry who, in time of war is posted outside the
camp, and whose functions are purely preventive,
whilst Hue and Cry was partly preventive and
partly repressive. Although the main object of the
latter institution was the apprehension of offenders,
quite half its value depended on the effect produced
on the minds of intending criminals by the fear that
any illegal act on their part might raise the whole
county in arms against them, and by the knowledge
that escape was well-nigh impossible.</p>

<p>The law against vagrancy was conceived in the
same spirit, the Statute in question requiring Bailiffs
of towns to make enquiry every week of all persons
lodging in the suburbs, in order that neither vagrants,
nor "people against the peace" might find shelter, a
regulation designed on the lines of the universal
police maxim "Allow the thief no rest." The custom
was to make the householder responsible for the
deeds of those whom he harboured, and to punish
the indiscriminate giver of alms.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>This method was not only more humane, but it
also proved more effectual than the everlasting imprisonment,
whipping, and branding of vagrants, that
Tudor legislation enjoined.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>Neglect of the Hue and Cry, failure to make
"fresh and quick pursuit," and sometimes want of
success when pursuit was duly made, were visited by
the imposition of fines upon the neglectful or unfortunate
inhabitants as the case might be: many
examples of this are on record, <i>e.g.</i> (Exchequer
Rolls, vol. i. sect. 14).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Item. The citizens of Lincoln fined fifty marks
for suffering a robber to escape, etc.: and the men
of Colchester for the like.</p>

<p>Item. (Sussex: 16 Edward I.) Homicide committed
in a fray: the offender who had stabbed his
adversary, a butcher, takes refuge in the Church of
Crawley and abjures the realm: townships of Crawley
and Hurst amerced because they did not make suit.</p>

<p>Item. A quarrel in an alehouse at Hodley, in
which a man is struck on the head and dies four
days afterwards. The offender escapes, and all the
persons present in the alehouse amerced, because
they did not secure him."<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When Hue and Cry had been raised against a
fugitive, every man had to lay aside his work and
join in the pursuit to the best of his ability, anyone
failing to do so, or withdrawing himself without permission,
was considered to have taken the part of the
person who was fleeing from justice, and the two
might be hunted down together, and when apprehended,
delivered to the Sheriffs, "not to be set at
liberty, but by the King, or by his chief justice."<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Once levied, Hue and Cry recognised no boundaries,
the pursuit spread from hundred to hundred, and
from county to county, "till they come to the seaside,"
or until the man surrendered himself. "The
life of Hue and Cry," says Coke, "is fresh suit," and
in order that valuable time should not be lost in
preliminary enquiries, no liability for malfeasance
attached to those who followed the chase; if therefore
an innocent man was hunted down, he had no
remedy against his pursuers, but, to obtain satisfaction,
had first to discover the author of the false
report. If the fugitive sought refuge in a house, and
refused to open the door, the peace officer might
break it open, and in the event of a man grievously
wounding another, it was held that killing was no
murder, provided that Hue and Cry had been duly
levied, and provided also, that the offender could not
otherwise be taken.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The best, and as a rule, the only practicable chance
of escape open to the pursued, lay in the possibility
of his reaching a sanctuary before the hunters came
up with him. If a man took sanctuary, his life was
safe, but he remained a close prisoner within the
precincts of the asylum in which he had found refuge
until he received the King's pardon, or until he purchased
his freedom by "abjuring the realm," an
undertaking which entailed upon him perpetual
banishment, besides the forfeiture of all his
belongings.</p>

<p>These sacred asylums, within whose precincts the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>law was powerless, were often made use of in a
manner never contemplated when the privilege of
affording protection to fugitives was first extended
to them. If an offender was unpopular his chance
of reaching sanctuary was very remote, it was easy
enough to head him off, or to surround the place in
such a manner that approach meant certain capture;
on the other hand, if the country folk were disposed
to favour the escape of the hunted man, there was
little difficulty in managing the pursuit in such a
way that he should reach his goal in safety. Hue
and Cry was therefore not as effectual as it ought to
have been, especially against men who for one reason
or another enjoyed the goodwill of their neighbours,
and its efficacy was still further reduced by the freedom
with which Charters of Pardon were granted by
the King to powerful nobles and others, who were
prepared to pay for the concession.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the Statute of Winchester upon
which his reputation as a police reformer mainly
rests, Edward I. was the author of other valuable
measures designed to produce and conserve a state
of public tranquillity. Under former rulers Sheriffs
had been allowed a dangerous amount of freedom,
which they had abused for their own advantage, both
by improperly admitting to bail offenders who ought
not to have been permitted to remain at large, and
by exacting bail from others on trivial or trumped-up
charges. This practice Edward combated, and
forbade sheriffs, under severe penalties, to hold to
bail any who were not strictly bailable. Mindful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>also of the disturbances wrought by idle rumour, he
set himself to put a stop to the dissemination of
scandal by irresponsible tale-bearers, and decreed
that henceforth those "who be so hardy as to tell
or publish any false news or tales whereby discord
may arise" should be "taken and kept in prison
until he is brought into the Court which was the
first author of the tale."<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Of greater practical value, however, were his
enactments dealing with Coroners<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> (so-called because
they were principally concerned with pleas of the
Crown). With the intention that these most important
officers should stand high in the estimation
of all men, Edward, in 1275, ordained that no one
under the degree of knight should be chosen to the
office, and in the year following he defined the
powers of Coroners, setting forth what steps they
were called upon to take for the better preservation
of the peace, and in what manner their functions
ought to be carried out. It was enacted<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> that, in
the event of any person meeting with an unnatural
or violent death, the township concerned had to immediately
give notice to the nearest Coroner, who
was thereupon bound to issue a precept to the
constables of the neighbouring vills, requiring them
to cause to appear before him a competent number of
good and lawful men in order that the matter might
forthwith be investigated at the place where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>corpse had been found. If, upon inquiry, and upon
the oath of the jurymen, it should appear that foul
play had been the cause of death, the Coroner was,
by the same statute, further instructed to use his
best endeavour to discover the guilty party, and if
the murderer was known, the Coroner was authorised
to deliver him to the Sheriff and to proceed to his
house, and there to cause a valuation of all his
belongings to be made, the amount thereof being
notified and secured to the township or hundred,
which was then answerable to the judges for any
amercement that might subsequently be imposed.
Nor was the business of holding inquisitions in cases
of sudden death the only duty of the Coroner; he
was also expected to make enquiry, in like manner,
of every reported case of housebreaking, and was
required to keep a watchful eye on any of the King's
subjects who seemed to live riotously, haunting
taverns and the like, and to attach them by four or
more pledges on the not unreasonable suspicion
that the funds which supported such extravagances
proceeded either from some illegal practice, or from
a secret store of treasure trove. Though answerable
to the King, Coroners were chosen by the
county, and sworn by the sheriff; any holder of the
office concealing felonies, or failing in his duty
through favour to the misdoers, was liable to be
fined at the King's pleasure and to be imprisoned
for a year.</p>

<p>Much of the good work done for the internal
peace of the kingdom by Edward I. was undone
by his successor, whose predilection for evil counsellors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>led to much Baronial resistance, and threw
the country back into that state of lawlessness from
which it had been delivered by the wise police
regulations of the Statute of Winchester.</p>

<p>Organised bands of robbers harried the country,
setting at defiance sheriffs, judges, and even the
King himself, who was stopped near Norwich by a
freebooting knight called Sir Gosseline Denville,
and stripped of his money and other valuables.
With such an example of reckless disregard of the
King's peace before them, it is not wonderful that
the lower orders of the people ignored the restrictions
that the law imposed; the weak had no
protectors, so the hand that was strong enough to
take and to hold fast was seldom empty. These
predatory rovers waxed so powerful, and grew so
numerous as the result of the impunity they enjoyed,
that nothing short of a regular military campaign
sufficed to free the land from their ravages. The
end of this same Denville illustrates the extensive
nature of these operations. After years spent in
successful plundering, and after an unprecedented
reward had been put on his head, he was at length
brought to bay by the sheriff of Yorkshire, who,
with five hundred men surrounded the inn where
the robber slept, and in the course of the desperate
fight which followed between the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse comitatus</i>
of the peace officer and the banditti, it is said that
two hundred men were killed before the knight and
his brother were captured.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Indolent and incapable as Edward II. proved,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>his police administration was not altogether without
merit, and an important Statute passed in the
eighteenth year of his reign is worthy of more than
passing notice. In order that the value of this Act
may be fully appreciated a few words of preliminary
explanation are necessary. One of the principal
functions of the Norman Sheriff at his annual visit
of inspection or Tourn, was to inform himself (by
making inquiry from the chief frankpledges) as to
the nature and extent of the crime existing in his
district, and to make a report thereof to the King,
if, in his opinion, any particular offence or class of
offences was unduly prevalent. The exercise of this
function, which was known as "presentment," to
some extent secured the trial and punishment of
criminals, by bringing their offences to the knowledge
of the central authority, and the officer who
made the report may, in a sense, be considered to
have acted the part of a public prosecutor. When
the Court Leet took the place of the Sheriff's Tourn
this function was partially lost, and the object of
the Statute in question was to increase the value of
the Court Leet as a preventive agency, by reaffirming
and clearly defining its responsibility with regard
to the important duty of presentment, which it had
inherited along with the other functions of the
Sheriff's Tourn. To this end Courts Leet were
now (1325) ordered to certify that all the chief-pledges
were present at the sitting of the Court to
which they were summoned, and that they duly
brought to the notice of the same Court all offences
committed within their knowledge. For their guidance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>a list of the matters which concerned them,
arranged under thirty-four headings, was added,
of which the most important were the following:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>(<i>a</i>) Of damages done to walls, houses, ditches and hedges set up or beaten down to annoyance.</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) Of Bounds withdrawn or taken away.</li>

<li>(<i>c</i>) Of breakers of houses.</li>

<li>(<i>d</i>) Of petty larrons, and their receivers (<i>i.e.</i> harbourers).</li>

<li>(<i>e</i>) Of such as go messages for thieves.</li>

<li>(<i>f</i>) Of cries levied and not pursued.</li>

<li>(<i>g</i>) Of bloodshed and of frays made.</li>

<li>(<i>h</i>) Of escape of thieves and felons.</li>

<li>(<i>i</i>) Of clippers and forgers of money.</li>

<li>(<i>j</i>) Of persons outlawed returned, not having the King's warrant.</li>

<li>(<i>k</i>) Of women ravished not presented before the Coroner.</li>

<li>(<i>l</i>) Of false balances, measures, and weights.</li>

<li>(<i>m</i>) Of such as continually haunt taverns, and no man knoweth whereon they do live.</li>

<li>(<i>n</i>) Of such as sleep by day, and watch by night, and eat and drink well, and have nothing.</li>

<li>(<i>o</i>) Of persons imprisoned and let go without mainprize.</li>

<li>(<i>p</i>) Of the Assize of Ale and Bread broken.</li>
</ul>

<p>A glance at the subjects enumerated in this
schedule is sufficient to illustrate the comprehensive
nature of the part assigned to Courts Leet in
the general scheme of peace maintenance, and to
show how in addition to their primary duty of
bringing to light all breaches of the peace, these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>local police courts were furthermore charged with
the supervision of everything that tends to promote
good order and good citizenship, such as, for example,
the regulating of weights and measures and the abatement
of public nuisances.</p>

<p>This Statute is entitled "A Statute for View of
Frankpledge," but it was not put forward with any
intention of reverting to the old system of police by
decennary societies, nor with any idea of superseding
or even modifying the Statute of Winchester, but
rather as an auxiliary measure to enlarge the sphere
of usefulness of that Statute, and to render its administration
more effectual, by ensuring that no
violations of its provisions should go undetected
and unpunished.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>JUSTICE AND CONSTABLE</small></h2>


<p>The accession of Edward III. marked the beginning
of a new police era, that of the petty constable
acting under the direction of the Justice of the
Peace. The Statute of Winchester continued to be
the guide in matters of police, but the executive
which carried out its provisions underwent a change.</p>

<p>Any attempt to follow in detail the history of the
Justices of the Peace, and the powers resident in
them, is beyond the scope of the present work; this
task has already been often and ably performed.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It
is impossible, however, to divorce the functions of the
Justice from those of the Constable; the story of the
evolution of the latter is so dovetailed into the history
of the former, the two are so closely allied in their
mutual relationship of master and servant, that some
reference must here and elsewhere be made to the
office of the Justice, a functionary who claims a
considerable share of attention in any enquiry
that deals with police in the full interpretation
of the word, because the executive power vested
in a Justice as Peace Officer is antecedent to, and
on the whole more important than, the judicial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>authority attaching to him as Magistrate: in other
words, he must be considered as a policeman first,
and as a judge afterwards.</p>

<p>The origin of the Justice's office is by no means
obscure. Towards the close of the twelfth century
(1195), by a proclamation of Richard I.,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Knights
were appointed to see that all males over the age of
fifteen years were "sworn to the King" by taking a
solemn oath to maintain the peace: after fifty years
or so had elapsed (1253) these Knights had become
Peace Wardens or Conservators, who again, continually
undergoing a process of development as the
importance of the Sheriffs dwindled, were eventually
invested with judicial powers, and were then known
as Justices of the Peace.</p>

<p>When the office of Justice was first created, it was
not intended that the Sheriff should be altogether
superseded, but rather that the new officer should
become an auxiliary agent for the preservation of
the peace, to co-operate, as the Conservator had
formerly done, with the Sheriff, who still retained
the primary responsibility for the policing of his
shire. It would appear that the supremacy of the
royal officer in matters of police was generally recognised
throughout the thirteenth century; for when, in
1285, Edward I. had occasion to rebuke the men of
Kent for the prevalence of crime in their county, he
made no mention of the Conservator, but ordered the
inhabitants to afford in future every assistance in
their power to the Sheriff, whose especial province
it was (so the King declared) to keep the peace, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>only by his own power, but also by means of the
"posse comitatus," or power of the county.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> On
the other hand, even at this time, the Sheriff was
not always given a free hand. In Warwickshire, for
example, all arrangements for the preservation of
the peace had first to be submitted to the Conservator
for his approval;<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> it cannot, however, be
supposed that the supervision exercised by the Conservators
over the police administration was more
than nominal, because, as a rule, they were great
noblemen, holding a plurality of offices, and because
the districts within their wardenship were usually too
large to be effectively controlled by any one man.
We learn, for instance, that in 1281 the Earl of
Cornwall was Peace Warden for the counties of
Middlesex, Essex, Herts, Cambs, Hunts, Norfolk,
Suffolk, Kent, Surrey, Oxon, Beds, Bucks, Berks,
Northants, Lincoln, and Rutland.</p>

<p>When both population and trade increased, and
when offenders and offences grew more varied and
numerous, it became necessary to augment to a proportionate
degree the staff of officers answerable to
the King for the internal peace of the kingdom: it
was no good making more Sheriffs, who had seldom
proved a success in the past (whose misconduct, in
fact, had led to the restricting of their power to do
harm on more than one occasion), and so it came
about that the Justice gradually superseded the
Conservator, and in the end not only deprived the
Sheriff of his judicial powers, but to a large extent
took his place as director of the police also.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>The Sheriff did not submit to this curtailment of
his authority without a struggle. After he was no
longer allowed to act in his old capacity, he sometimes
managed to get made a Justice, and to hold both
offices in the same county at one time, to the great
oppression of the people, who bitterly complained of
the heavy fines that were inflicted, and of the outrageous
bail that was exacted by these pluralists,
until in 1378, at the request of Parliament, Richard
II. put an end to such practices. Nevertheless,
the Sheriff still remained the responsible person for
the levying of Hue and Cry, for the pursuit and
apprehension of felons, for the due execution of the
sentences pronounced by the law-courts, and was
answerable for the persons of prisoners handed over
to him for punishment. He also had to perform
various duties connected with elections, and until
the reign of Edward VI. retained certain military
functions.</p>

<p>Before 1328, the so-called justices were executive
officers only, "they were little more than constables
on a large scale";<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> but in this year, Edward the
Third, who had recently come to the throne, considerably
extended their powers by entrusting to
them the examination and punishment of law-breakers.</p>

<p>The King reserved to himself the right of nominating
those who should hold the office, and, throughout
his long reign, continued to take the liveliest interest
in his Justices of the Peace. He ordered that they
should be connected with the county for which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>were appointed, by holding therein a certain amount
of landed property, a qualification which has been
retained for many centuries. He made it a condition
that they should be <i lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">bons gentz et loiaulx</i>; and
for fear lest the granting of judicial powers to local
officials should open the door to extortion on the
one hand, and to ignorant maladministration on the
other, was very careful as to the class of man he
selected. For this reason, the pleadings of Parliament
notwithstanding, he could not be induced to
give up the privilege of appointing his own nominees,
and even the democratic tendencies of modern times
have left the appointment of Justices of the Peace in
the hands of the Crown. Another Statute<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> (also
passed in 1328) ordained that no man should "go
offensively" or "ride armed" before the new magistrates&mdash;a
wise enactment designed to protect them
from being brow-beaten and intimidated by those
great nobles who sought to obtain their own ends
through the awe inspired by the display of a large
armed retinue.</p>

<p>In 1333<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Edward informed the Commons that
one of his principal reasons for calling them together
was to take counsel with them concerning the means
that should be adopted for preserving the peace, and
to this end charged them to assist him to the best
of their ability. The Commons readily accepted the
invitation, and subsequently lost no opportunity of
expressing the interest they took in the Justices of
the Peace, whose office was the constant theme
of suggestions and petitions, which, however, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>King, who preferred to take his own line, usually
disregarded.</p>

<p>Of the several Statutes that were successively
passed dealing with the office in question, the most
important became law in 1360.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> "In every county
in England, there shall be assigned for the keeping
of the peace, one lord, and with him three or four of
the most worthy men in the county, together with
some learned in the law, and they shall have power
to restrain offenders, rioters, and other barretors,
and to pursue, arrest, take, and chastise them,
according to their trespass or offence; and to cause
them to be arrested and duly punished according to
the law and custom of the realm, and according to
that which to them shall seem best to do by their
discretions and good advisement; ... and to take
of all them that be not of good fame, where they
shall be found, sufficient surety and mainprise of
their good behaviour toward the King and his
people ... and also to hear and determine at the
King's suit all manner of felonies and trespasses
done in the same county according to the laws and
customs aforesaid."</p>

<p>Two years after the Statute above quoted had
been enacted, the Justices were empowered to sit
quarterly for the transaction of business,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and before
long Quarter Sessions absorbed the major portion of
the executive and administrative government of the
county.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>When Richard II. ascended the throne, the Justice
of the Peace was thus firmly established as one of
the permanent institutions of the kingdom. Since
that time, the office has passed through many
vicissitudes, experiencing many a rise and many a
fall; but through all these changes, the Statute
quoted above, which first defined his position, has
always been referred to when any doubt arose as to
the powers a Justice may exercise by virtue of his
commission, and its meaning has been stretched and
extended by degrees until, as Burn says, "there is
scarcely any other Statute which hath received such
a largeness of interpretation."<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>It will be observed that in addition to the powers
given to Justices for the punishment of offences
against the peace, express authority was also conferred
upon them by the same instrument for the
prevention of such offences, for they were specially
ordered to "take sufficient surety and mainprise of
all them that be not of good fame." We have seen
how under the decennary or tything system, all freemen
were bound to find sureties for the preservation
of the peace, and we have watched the decay of that
system after the Norman invasion; in the provisions
of this Act of Parliament, however, we may discover
at least a partial revival of the ancient plan of
demanding guarantees against any contingent infraction
of the public peace, and of associating in a
joint pecuniary responsibility the actual or potential
peacebreaker with his immediate neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The
"sufficient security" which Justices were authorised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>to take might be of two kinds&mdash;"Surety of the
Good Behaviour" and "Surety of the Peace," and
the security might be by Bail or by Mainprise, the
difference between the two being "that mainpernors
are only surety, but bail is a custody; and therefore
the bail may retake the prisoner, if they doubt he
may fly, and detain him."<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> ... Sureties of the
Good Behaviour and Sureties of the Peace were
granted on suspicion or on the flimsiest sort of
evidence; for instance, "any suspected person who
lives idly, and yet fares well, or is well apparelled,
having nothing whereon to live," any common
gamester, or the reputed father of a bastard child,
or an eaves-dropper even, might be called upon to
find mainpernors or bail; and so great discretion was
required on the part of the Justices, who had to
decide such knotty points; it was consequently of
the highest importance that these officers should be
familiar with the districts in which their duties were
performed, and legal erudition was a consideration
subordinate to personal character and local knowledge.
When the Law was young evidence was
received for what it was held to be worth, without
distinction as to whether it might be hearsay, circumstantial,
or direct; the word of a thane would prevail
against the evidence of six ceorls; in fact the
credibility of every witness was appraised in proportion
to his social position, just as a man's life had
formerly been estimated at a distinct valuation, and
scheduled according to a recognised scale.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The feudal system had taught the retainer to look
to the Lord of the Manor for the redress of any
grievance that he might have against his neighbour.
To the tribunal of the Manor, also, he was wont to
bring family differences for settlement; here the
father would recount the follies of his son, and the
wife complain of the habits of her husband: for, just
as the priest was the spiritual adviser to his congregation,
so, in many instances, was the Lord of the
Manor the lay-counsellor to the dwellers on his
estate. It was essential, therefore, that the Justice,
who had to perform many of the duties formerly
attaching to the feudal lord, should be a local man
and a man of position; people would have nothing
to do with a stranger, or with one who, in their
opinion, was a man of no account, however great a
lawyer he might be.</p>

<p>The status of the Justice of the Peace at the time
of Edward IV. was not very different from that held
by the same functionary at the present day. His
powers and duties are not now quite the same as
they once were, but the history of the office has
been remarkable for its steady persistence in one
groove: the Justices of five hundred years ago might
be defined as a select number of country gentlemen
deriving their authority from the Crown, primarily
responsible to the Crown for the preservation of
the peace, and exercising judicial functions of a
simple kind within the limits of the county for
which they were appointed&mdash;and such a definition
would still apply.</p>

<p>The rise of the Justice of the Peace at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>expense of his rivals was due to some extent to
political causes. Sovereigns were favourable to the
growing importance of an estate that promised to
act as a counterpoise to the arrogant claims of
the nobles, and although Parliament had nothing
to do with the appointment of the new magistrates
it was generally in sympathy with them, because
they did not abuse their powers as the sheriffs had
done, nor neglect their duties like the conservators;
and also because the House of Commons, which
was almost entirely composed of country gentlemen,
recognised in the Justices, members of the same
social class to which they themselves belonged. The
mass of the people, too, were inclined to view
them with favour, choosing to place themselves and
their fortunes in the hands of men they knew something
about, who were on the spot and likely to
execute justice speedily, rather than in the hands of
strange judges whose visits were few and far between,
and who, when they came, were likely to be deficient
in local knowledge.</p>

<p>The first Justices therefore were in the enviable
position of enjoying at one and the same time the
hearty support of King, Commons, and People; but
unfortunately such a healthy state was not destined
to be permanent, and before long the symptoms of
internal disease presented themselves.</p>

<p>As the attractions of town life increased it became
more and more difficult to obtain the services of the
best kind of country gentlemen for a post that was
often arduous, that brought no emolument to the
holder, and that was incompatible with absenteeism.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>An inferior type of man was glad enough to take
the place for the sake of the patronage and the
social position he thereby acquired, and a corresponding
depreciation in the police administration
was at once apparent. Richard II. endeavoured to
counteract this tendency by ordaining that Justices
should be possessed of property in their own county
of a minimum annual value of twenty pounds, and at
the same time relieved them of some of their routine
duties by appointing Clerks of the Peace to assist
them. He fixed the number of Justices for each
county at eight, two of whom only had to be in
attendance at each Sessions.</p>

<p>These remedial measures served their purpose for
the time, but in after years we find the danger
resulting from the admission of inferior men into
the ranks of the Justices constantly recurring, necessitating
a more rigid enforcement of the property
qualification.</p>

<p>In the city of London the duties that in the
country would have fallen to the Justices of the
Peace were performed instead by the Mayor and
Aldermen, a custom that has been continued ever
since, and with good results.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>All that remains to be said on the subject of
Justices of the Peace in this place must be compressed
into a few lines. Various Statutes, passed
between 1389 and 1399, multiplied their powers
exceedingly by giving them authority to settle the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>wages of labourers and servants, to punish unlawful
huntings, false weights in the staple, and the unlawful
wearing of liveries. In the reign of Henry IV.
they were directed by statute to suppress riots with
the help of the Sheriff and his "posse," and Henry V.
ordained that, in future, Justices should only be appointed
from "the most sufficient men of the counties,
resident respectively therein," and that they should
thenceforward be nominated by the King's Council.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The Yorkist period saw Justices of the Peace at
the zenith of their power; for, although the importance
of the office tended to increase rather than
to diminish, Tudor sovereigns, always masters in
their own house, refused to allow them the same
measure of independence that they had before enjoyed&mdash;in
fact, one of the first acts of Henry VII.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
was to rate them soundly for their past negligence,
and to threaten unpleasant consequences if an improvement
was not quickly manifest.</p>

<p>Subordinate to the Justices were the petty constables;
"the lowe and lay ministers of the peace"
as Lambard calls them; these officers were appointed
annually by the jury of the Court Leet, but their
control was vested almost entirely in the hands of
the magistrates who swore them in, and who afterwards
directed their actions.</p>

<p>Careful investigation into the origin and precise
nature of the petty constable's office has failed to
set finally at rest the many discussions that have
arisen from time to time, and has left some minor
points still obscure; the essentials, however, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>sufficiently clear for the purposes of the present
inquiry.</p>

<p>The word "constable" was imported by the Normans,
but its etymology is not quite certain; formerly
it was said to be derived from "Conning," a king,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
and "Stapel," a stay or prop, and to signify "the
king's right-hand man," but this is an unlikely solution,
because the invaders despised the Anglo-Saxon
language, and would not use a word which was partly
derived from that tongue. Latterly the derivation
"Comes-stabuli," meaning an Equerry or Master of
the Horse, has been generally accepted as correct.
In England the title has been applied to a variety of
functionaries, some high and some low, who had little
in common beyond the fact that they all owed their
authority to the Crown.</p>

<p>The first mention of petty constables occurs in
1252, in a writ of Henry III. for enforcing watch
and ward. This writ provides for the employment of
these officers in parish and township, but it is more
than likely that the office was not then a new one,
because the word "constable" is there used without
any explanation being added, and it may therefore
be assumed that its meaning was a matter of common
knowledge.</p>

<p>The Statute of Winchester, it will be remembered,
ordained that there should be two constables in each
hundred, to carry out the inspection of arms; these
officers were probably connected with the Militia,
and were closely allied to, if not identical with, the
High Constables of later date; in any case they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>must not be confused with the petty constables, who,
according to Blackstone, were so called when they
added the duties of assistants to the High Constable,
to their ancient business of keeping the peace, and
who, as Lambard explains, were modified tythingmen;
"when there be many tythingmen in one
parish, there only one of them is a constable for the
king, and the rest do serve but as the ancient
tythingmen did."</p>

<p>The transition from the Anglo-Saxon tythingman
to the petty constable, that is to say, from the chief
frankpledge to the Justice's assistant was very gradual,
and it is impossible to determine a rigid boundary
line between the two. All we can say is that the
term "constable" was introduced as early as the
year 1252, and that the term "tything man" continued
to be occasionally made use of down to the
beginning of the nineteenth century: that first and
last the offices were in effect the same does not admit
of doubt, both were primarily <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</i> guardians of
the peace, and when the tything man came to be
commonly called "constable," it does not follow that
the change marked the creation of a new office.</p>

<p>The Normans naturally substituted French or
Latin names for Anglo-Saxon ones; headborough
became <span xml:lang="la" lang="la">præpositus</span>, and shire-reeve or sheriff became
<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">vicecomes</span>. Of these foreign titles, the former is now
never used, and the latter<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> has acquired a new meaning
totally distinct from its original sense. "Constable,"
on the other hand, survived, although at first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>it was used only by the Normans, and in official
documents, the people continuing to employ the
native words according to the custom of the different
parts of the country; thus in Middlesex there were
Headboroughs, in Kent Borsholders, and in the West
of England tythingmen.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to pursue the matter further
except to say, that when the Justices of the Peace,
owing to the increased amount of work thrown upon
them, were in want of subordinate officers, advantage
was taken of the staff of tythingmen already existing,
some of whom were given new functions, <i>e.g.</i> the
execution of the Justices' warrants and the service of
summonses, but without prejudice to their duties in
connection with peace-maintenance; in short, the
titles of tythingman, petty-constable, parish-constable,
and finally police-constable, are the various names
applied to the same office from the time of Alfred
the Great to that of King Edward the Seventh.</p>

<p>We do not know enough about the social distinctions
of the period to say what the precise status of
the early constable was. His position was without
doubt an honourable one, superior in every way to
that of the parish constable of later years, who only
served because he could not help it, or because he
was poor enough to bear another man's burden for a
paltry pecuniary consideration.</p>

<p>The local competence of the officer has always
been insisted upon, and his incapacity to exercise
any powers outside a particular area was one of the
causes that contributed to make him the useless nonentity
that he at one time became. So close was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>connection between constable and parish that the
Court of King's Bench decided, in 1734, that a place
that did not employ one constable at least must be
considered merely as a hamlet, and was not entitled
to the privileges that belonged to an independent
township; and whenever similar questions arose, the
decision invariably turned on the existence or the
non-existence of a parish constable.</p>

<p>The qualifications that a constable ought to possess
are thus tabulated by Coke:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>i. Honesty: to execute his office truly without malice, affection, or partiality.</li>

<li>ii. Knowledge: to understand his duty, what he ought to do.</li>

<li>iii. Ability: as well in estate as in body,
that so he may attend and execute his office diligently,
and not neglect the same through
want or impotency.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It would be tedious to recount the multifarious
duties that from time to time have fallen to the constable,
especially as many of the most important are
noticed in subsequent chapters; it will here be sufficient
to state, in a general way, a few of the main
directions by which he was expected to act: these
may shortly be summarized as follows:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>i. His duties with regard to watch and ward were,
to keep a roster of the watchmen, to see that
they were vigilant and alert during the hours
of watching, to receive into custody any
guilty or reasonably suspected person handed
over to him by the watch, and to keep such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
person in safety, until he should give bail or
be brought before a Justice of the Peace.</li>

<li>ii. With regard to Hue and Cry, and generally
with regard to the pursuit and arrest of
felons, peacebreakers and suspected persons,
his duty was to obey the sheriff, to follow
with the Hue and Cry, and to keep in safe
custody any prisoner delivered to him, until
relieved of further responsibility by the orders
of Justice or Sheriff.</li>

<li>iii. With regard to inquiring into, and prosecuting
offences: he was bound to make presentment
at the assizes, sessions of the peace or leet,
and in some cases before the coroner, "of all
bloodsheddings, affrays, outcries, rescues, and
other offences committed or done against the
King's Majesty's Peace."</li>

<li>iv. Finally he had to serve precepts, warrants and
summonses, and obey all the lawful commands
of the High Constable and Justice of
the Peace.</li>
</ul>

<p>The subordination of petty constables to Justices
was from the first generally understood and acted
upon, but the custom did not receive definite official
sanction until the seventeenth century, when it was
tardily recognised by statute.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The true relationship
between the two has found apt expression in an old
simile which likens constables to the eyes and hands
of the Justices, "eyes to see through the medium of
presentments, and hands to act by virtue of warrants
or process."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>FOREST POLICE AND POLICE IN THE
FIFTEENTH CENTURY</small></h2>


<p>Just as the state of public tranquillity brought
about by the wise government of Edward I.
had been disturbed by the irresponsible and
childish behaviour of his pleasure-loving successor,
so was the admirable domestic policy of Edward III.
robbed of its due reward by the lack of judgment
and the want of administrative capacity exhibited
by Richard II., whose unhappy reign is thus described
by Froissart. "The State generally of all
men in England began to murmur and to rise one
against another, and ministering of justice was clear
stopped up in all courts of England, whereof the
valiant men and prelates, who loved rest and peace,
and were glad to pay their duties, were greatly
abashed; for there rose in the realm companies in
divers routs, keeping the fields and highways, so that
merchants durst not ride abroad to exercise their
merchandise for doubt of robbing; and no man
knew to whom to complain to do them right, reason,
and justice; which things were right prejudicial and
displeasant to the good people of England, for it
was contrary to their accustomable usage."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p>It would be unjust, however, to attribute the state
of affairs as above portrayed solely to Richard's
incapacity: he was still a minor when his grandfather
died, and many circumstances conspired
to render his task an extremely difficult one. A
latent discontent had smouldered amongst the
peasantry ever since the oppressive Statute of
Labourers had been passed some thirty years
before, and the universal poll-tax of one shilling a
head, imposed in 1379 to meet the expenses incurred
in the interminable wars with France and
Scotland, suddenly caused the flame of rebellion to
blaze forth with unexampled violence. It has been
said that if anything like an adequate police force
had been available in 1381, Wat Tyler's movement
might have been arrested before the riots in the
Southern Counties had attained the dimensions of
a general insurrection. Such may, or may not, be
true of this particular rising; but happily for English
liberty there has never existed in this country any
police force at the disposal of the central government,
powerful enough to coerce the nation at large.
Our national police has always been of the people
and for the people, and obviously at no time could
long be used to oppress those from whom its
strength was derived, provided only that one and
the same sentiment pervaded a majority of the
oppressed.</p>

<p>The attack on villenage was too reasonable to be
fruitless, and resistance to the popular demands could
be but temporary. The death of Tyler, and the
consequent suppression of the insurrectionary movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>which he led, caused the concessions wrung
from the King to be revoked, and so delayed the
cause of agrarian freedom; but the ultimate triumph
of free tenure and labour was already assured from the
moment that unanimity was achieved.</p>

<p>The constitution of the general police of the
country being of such a nature that it was powerless
to enforce any universally unpopular measure, a
distinct and separate organisation was required to
administer the well-hated code of law which had to
do with the royal prerogative of hunting. The whole
subject of forest law and forest police is of sufficient
interest and importance to warrant an account of its
main characteristics in some detail.</p>

<p>The King's Peace, as we have already seen, was
of two kinds&mdash;there was the public peace of the
realm, and there was the royal or private peace,
enjoyed by the Sovereign, and by those closely
connected with him. If we examine further these
main divisions, we shall find that each is composed of
certain sub-divisions, with their own particular laws
and customs: thus under the general heading of
public peace must be included&mdash;(1) the peace and
privacy to which every man is entitled at his own
fireside, securing him against all intrusion as long
as he commits no felonious action&mdash;(2) the "peace
of the church" as kept by the Ecclesiastical Courts&mdash;and
(3) the "peace of the sea" with its court
(afterwards known as the Court of Admiralty) "to
maintain peace and justice amongst the people of
every nation passing through the sea of England."<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The private peace of the King, besides protecting
his person and the precincts of his palaces, extended
also over all the Royal Forest land, that is to say,
over about a third part of the whole area of England:
Canute's law was "I will that every man be entitled
to his hunting in wood and field, on his own possession.
And let everyone forego my hunting";<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> but
there is no evidence to prove that the Danish King
enforced his forest law otherwise than by the
ordinary law of the land. The system of game
preservation that grew up under the Normans, however,
was so rigid that it necessitated the creation of
special laws, special courts of law, and a special
police for the prevention and punishment of illegal
hunting. The Norman code was modified somewhat
by Magna Carta,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and again in 1217; but it continued
to oppress the nation through many generations,
for wherever the peace of the forest was well
maintained, there did the peace of the people suffer.</p>

<p>The amount of afforested land varied considerably
from time to time. Henry II. possessed 68 forests,
13 chaces and 781 parks,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> but it was not necessarily
those monarchs who were particularly devoted to
sport that were the most exacting, a strict enforcement
of the forest laws brought much money to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>royal exchequer in the shape of fines levied on
trespassers and others who were tempted to offend
against the arbitrary restrictions imposed.</p>

<p>"A Forest," says Manwood,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> "is a certain territory
of woody grounds and fruitful pastures, privileged
for wild beasts and fowls of forest, chase and
warren to rest, and abide there in the safe protection
of the King, for his delight and pleasure: which
territory of ground so privileged is mered and
bounded with irremovable marks, meres and boundaries,
either known by matter of record or by prescription:
and also replenished with wild beasts of
venery and chase, and with great coverts of vert,
for the succour of the said beasts (to have their
abode in): for the continuance and preservation of
the said place, together with the vert and venison,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
there are particular officers, laws and privileges
belonging to the same, requisite for the purpose,
and proper only to a Forest and no other place."</p>

<p>In connection with every forest there were four
Courts, called respectively the Woodmote Court,
the Court of Regard, the Court of Swanimote, and
the Court of the Justice Seat. Of these the first
was only competent to inquire of offences, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>could not proceed to conviction. The Verderers,
as the judicial officers of this Court were called, met
once in every forty days, and could acquit accused
persons, or hold them to bail&mdash;in the latter case
the attachment had to be by the goods of the
offender, unless he was "taken with the Mayneer,"
<i>i.e.</i> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in flagrante delicto</i>,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> when the attachment might
be by his body. "If any Forester shall find any
man attachable for Vert in the Forest, first he
shall attach him by two pledges, if they be to be
found: and if he be afterwards found, he shall
attach him by four pledges: and if the third time,
he shall be presented before the Verderers, and be
put by eight pledges: after the third attachment,
his body shall be attached and retained, that he
may remember what thing Vert is."<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Coke tells us that there were four degrees of
"Mayneer," viz.:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>(i.) Dog-draw, or tracking a wounded deer.</li>

<li>(ii.) Stable-Stand, that is, standing ready to shoot
or course, with weapon in hand, or greyhounds
in leash.</li>

<li>(iii.) Back-bear, or carrying away the venison; and</li>

<li>(iv.) Bloody-Hand, or being found in the forest
stained with blood.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The second Court, that of "Regard," was held
once in three years, and had for its object the
prevention of unlawful hunting. For this purpose
all dogs belonging to dwellers near the forest were
registered and divided into three classes; that is to
say (1) greyhounds, including spaniels and lurchers;
(2) mastiffs, including the various kinds of large
dogs; and (3) dogs of the smaller breeds. No
restriction was placed on the possession of the last-mentioned
class, but whilst greyhounds were not
allowed on any pretence, mastiffs might be kept
by a man for his own protection, provided that he
had them mutilated in such a way that they could
not pursue and pull down the game. This operation,
called "lawing" or "expeditation," consisted in
removing the claws of the fore-feet, and was performed
in the following manner&mdash;One of the dog's
fore-feet was placed upon a piece of wood eight inches
thick and twelve inches square, and then the three claws
were struck off at one blow with a two-inch chisel; if a
mastiff was found "unlawed" near a forest, a fine of
five shillings was imposed on its reputed master.</p>

<p>The "Court of Swanimote" met three times a
year, and had the power not only of inquiring into
all alleged offences against the forest laws, but,
unlike the Woodmote, might also convict. Finally,
judgment was given and sentences passed by the
chief Justice of the Forest, at the triennial meeting
of the Court of the Justice Seat.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Each forest was surrounded by its "purlieu," or
belt of pasturage, for the deer to graze in. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>jurisdiction of the Courts above enumerated extended
over both forest and purlieu, and since the
two together covered a third part of the kingdom,
it will be seen that the police regulations that
secured the peace of the forest profoundly affected
the daily life of the nation. Many of these regulations
pressed very hardly on the people, especially
on folk who had the misfortune to live in the
purlieu: for instance, a man found trespassing by
night could be imprisoned, even if he was only in
search of strayed cattle, and his beasts might be
confiscated. In times of drought, or when grazing
was scarce, foresters might lop trees and cut fodder
for their charges on the land of any man, whilst
tanners and dealers in horn were not permitted
to live anywhere in the neighbourhood of a forest,
for fear lest their trade should tempt them to become
receivers of stolen property.</p>

<p>When an offence had been committed Hue and
Cry might be made by any of the King's ministers
of the forest, but the pursuit had to be "fresh";
that is to say, the offender had to be detected in
the act, and the fugitive kept always in sight.
Pursuit, on suspicion, was illegal, and Hue and Cry
was applicable to Trespass in Venison only, not to
Trespass in Vert. If any township or village failed
to follow the Hue and Cry they were liable to be
amerced at the Justice Seat for the default.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>From the "Carta de foresta"<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> we learn that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>officers originally appointed to each forest were
fifty-two in number, and consisted of four <span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Primarii</span>
or Chiefs of the forest, sixteen <span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Mediocres homines</span>,
or Yoongmen, and thirty-two <span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Minuti homines</span>, or
Tine-men. This organization did not long continue,
however, and was quite extinct at the accession
of Henry II. The four <span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Primarii</span> were superseded
by four Verderers; the sixteen Yoongmen gave
place to twelve Regarders; and instead of thirty-two
Tine-men we find a staff of Foresters, with
their underlings, called Walkers or Rangers.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The
number of Foresters and Rangers employed was
not arbitrarily fixed, but varied with the size of
the forest, and in accordance with the exigencies
of time and place. The ministers of the forest
appear to have been very numerous in the days
of the Plantagenets, and the functions of the different
grades were clearly defined: thus, the
Verderers were judicial officers, roughly corresponding
to Justices of the Peace; the Agisters
were officers whose business it was to look after
the pasturage of the purlieu; the Regarders were
responsible for the lawing of dogs; whilst the
Foresters and Rangers were sworn to preserve the
wild beasts and timber respectively in their several
bailiwicks. The precautions taken to preserve the
peace of the forest were doubled during the Month
of Fence, or breeding season, at which time the
officers were ordered to be more than usually
vigilant, and offences were punished with increased
severity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>In the last chapter reference was made to the
oath which every male over fifteen years of age
had to take in furtherance of the general scheme
of peace-maintenance. Similarly, under forest law,
an oath was required from all the inhabitants of
the forest, that they would not disturb the peace
of the wild beasts therein. Manwood says that this
oath was anciently administered in doggerel verse,
in some such words as these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"You shall true Liege-man be,</div>
      <div class="verse">Unto the King's Majestie:</div>
      <div class="verse">Unto the beasts of the Forest you shall no hurt do,</div>
      <div class="verse">Nor anything that doth belong thereunto:</div>
      <div class="verse">The offences of others you shall not conceal,</div>
      <div class="verse">But to the utmost of your power you shall them reveal,</div>
      <div class="verse">Unto the officers of the Forest,</div>
      <div class="verse">Or to them who may see them redrest:</div>
      <div class="verse">All these things you shall see done,</div>
      <div class="verse">So help you GOD at his Holy Doom."<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Such then in brief were the salient features of the
police arrangements by which the prerogative of
hunting was secured to the Sovereign, arrangements
which, it will be seen, were closely allied to the
general scheme of peace maintenance then in vogue
throughout the realm. A fuller description of
Forest Law, together with an interesting map of
the Forest lands, may be found in Mr Inderwick's
"The King's Peace": the present enquiry, however,
must not extend beyond this slight survey of
the machinery by which the laws in question were
enforced, and may conclude with a glance at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>influence that such legislation exerted over the
country at large. The severity of the law coupled
with the inadequacy of the executive government
produced their natural result. The people resented
the harsh treatment they were subjected to, and
broke the unpopular regulations or evaded the irksome
restrictions whenever they could, which was
not seldom. Many who under a wiser régime would
have remained good citizens became outlaws merely
out of a spirit of opposition, and in consequence,
these huge tracts of forest, whose recesses were
hardly ever visited even by the forest officers, and
whose boundaries were hardly known to anyone
else, became the stronghold of the lawless and disaffected,
as well as the refuge of the unfortunate.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>In the opinion of many, our existing game laws,
are harsh and tyrannical: it is often said that all
men have an inalienable right to chase or snare any
animal that is not domesticated, because, in the
nature of things, a wild beast cannot have an owner.
All this may be perfectly true, but if such a common
right existed, it has not been enjoyed for a very
long time, not since the days, perhaps, when our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>forefathers performed their Druidical rites at the
monoliths of Stonehenge, apparelled only in woad
and mistletoe. It is unprofitable to argue about the
rights of prehistoric man: what was best for him is
not always applicable to a twentieth century community,
and we may be thankful that whilst a few
beasts of warren and chase still remain to us, we are
no longer oppressed, as men used to be, by a relentless
"lex foresta" for their protection.</p>

<p>To return, however, from the digression into which
the consideration of forest law has led, to the more
general theme of the police system of the Statute of
Winchester, it is to be observed that the terms "Watch"
and "Ward," though commonly used in conjunction
to express a single idea, are not really synonymous.
Blackstone says that the ward was set by day, and
the watch by night, and that the one begins only
when the other ends. Without making too much of
the distinction between the two, we must remember
that the population was almost entirely an agricultural
one, and was occupied throughout the day
in the fields; consequently every man could protect
his own property and, if necessary, raise the hue
and cry against any who came to despoil him.
Household belongings were few, and apparently of
such little account that not only were they always
left unprotected in the daytime, but it was even
thought unnecessary to employ a nightly police
except during the summer and autumn months,
when the crops were ripening in the fields, the
Statute only requiring the watch to be set "from the
day of the Ascension until the day of St Michael."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<p>The method of setting the watch was by house-row,
that is to say, a list of the dwellings in every
parish and township was prepared, and as his turn
came round each householder or some one lodging
under his roof was required to keep a watch: if
any such "contemptuously refused" to obey the
summons of the constable, that officer might set
him in the stocks for his contempt. The liability to
watch by roster attached equally to all the male
inhabitants; when, however, it happened that it
came to a woman's turn, she was allowed to find a
substitute, but there is no evidence to show whether
the substituted service was rendered gratuitously or
whether she had to pay for the accommodation.
Watchmen were expected to be able-bodied and
sufficiently armed, a pitchfork was not held to be
an adequate weapon,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> but within reasonable limits
a man might arm and accoutre himself as he pleased,
and it was not until comparatively recent times that
the watch were provided with arms at the parish
expense.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the house-row arrangement
worked smoothly enough, but that friction occasionally
arose, when the constables came to call upon unwilling
citizens to perform the police duties incumbent on
them, the following extract from "Town Life in the
Fifteenth Century" bears witness: "In Aylesbury"
according to the constables' report, "one Reygg
kept a house all the year until the watch time came,
and when he was summoned to the watch there
came Edward Chalkyll 'fasesying' and said he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>would not watch for no man and thus bare him up,
and that caused the other to be bolder for to bar
the King's watch.... He said and threatened us
with his master," add the constables, "and thus we
be over crakyd' that we dare not go, for when they
be 'mayten' they be the bolder. John Bossey
said the same wise that he would not watch for
us, and three others lacked each of them a night."<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The police regulations for the government of
London, as introduced in 1285, had become very
minute and exacting by the latter half of the
fifteenth century, many restrictions being placed on
the enjoyment of personal liberty. The use of coal
was prohibited, Sunday trading was forbidden, and,
amongst other rules for the control of the wheeled
traffic, a maximum width between wheels for vehicles
was laid down which might on no account be exceeded.
Ordinances also were promulgated against
tradesmen who should attempt to advertise their
callings in an objectionable manner, such as, for
instance, the display of a basin of blood by barbers
anxious to let people know that phlebotomy was
included in the list of their accomplishments. The
provisions of the before-quoted Statuta Civitatis
(London), touching the control of leprous persons
continued in force, and about this time special
officers were appointed to prevent such as were
infected with the plague from associating with those
who were whole.</p>

<p>The employment of a "police des m&oelig;urs" was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>novel feature of the administration. A register containing
the names of all women of ill-fame was kept
by the police, and such women were not allowed to
reside within the city walls; a certain promenade,
known as the "Stews of Southwark," was assigned
to them, where they were kept under the vigilant
eyes of the City Sergeants, who, in consideration of
the extra work thus thrown upon them, might confiscate
and retain as a perquisite any "minever fur or
cendale silk" that a courtesan might presume to
wear. The inhabitants of the Surrey suburb were
probably not consulted as to the desirability or
otherwise of this arrangement, Edward III. having
granted the town and borough of Southwark <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in perpetuo</i>
to the citizens of London. This he did in
answer to their complaint that the peace of the city
was continually being placed in jeopardy by the
facility with which thieves and felons could make
good their escape over the river and take refuge in
Southwark, a place with no recognised privilege of
sheltering runaways. The official sanctuaries were
of course on a different footing, and in the fifteenth
century were rendered less dangerous to society,
than had formerly been the case, by an ordinance
which required those who lived hard by the sanctuary
to watch all avenues of escape by day and
night until the refugee surrendered himself, a fine of
five pounds being levied against the responsible
ward if he succeeded in getting away.</p>

<p>The general scope of the responsibilities and
powers proper to these old-time city constables is
clearly defined in the oath that they were required
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>to take before entering upon the duties of their
office. "You shall swear, that you shall keep the
Peace of our Lord the King well and lawfully
according to your power, and shall arrest all those
who shall make any contest, riot, debate or affray, in
breaking of the said peace, and shall bring them
unto the house or Compter of one of the Sheriffs.
And if you shall be withstood by strength of such
misdoers, you shall raise upon them hue and cry
(and) shall follow them from street to street, and
from ward to ward until they are arrested. And
also you shall search at all times when you shall be
required by Scavenger or Bedel, for the common
nuisances of the ward; until they are arrested.
And also if there be anything done within your
bailiwick contrary to the Ordinances of the City.
And the faults you shall find, you shall present
them unto the Mayor and to the Officers of the
said City. And if you should be withstood by any
person, or persons, that you cannot duly do your
office, you shall certify unto the Mayor and Council
of the said City the name and names of such person
or persons who trouble you. And this you shall
not fail to do. So God you help and the Saints."<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>When the decennary societies ceased to exist, the
connection between the peace officer and the
particular group which he represented underwent a
change, but the alteration was one of degree rather
than one of kind. The fifteenth century constable
was taught to look for the support of his fellow-citizens
in case of need, though not to the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>extent, perhaps, as the headborough was wont to
rely on the members of his tything. The great
principle of mutual responsibility remained, and
was kept alive by insisting that all freemen should
enter into a solemn obligation to keep the peace,
a compact which, modified to suit more modern
requirements, had its origin in the ancient oath of
allegiance. The form of oath varied in different
places; in London it was as follows&mdash;"You shall
swear that you shall be good and true unto the
King of England and to his heirs, Kings and the
King's Peace you shall keep; and unto the Officers
of the city you shall be obedient, and at all times
that shall be needful, you shall be ready to aid the
officers in arresting misdoers, and those disobedient
to the King's Peace, as well denizens as strangers.
And you shall be ready, at the warning of the
Constables and Bedels, to make the watches and
(to bear) the other charges for the safeguard of the
peace, and all the points in this wardmote shown,
according to your power you shall well and lawfully
keep&mdash;and if you know any evil covin within the
ward or the city, you shall withstand the same, or
to your alderman make it known. So help you
God and the Saints."<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>An examination of the oaths administered to
constables and freemen respectively reveals to us
in a concise form the motives which directed the
mediæval machinery for maintaining the peace.
We see how a compromise was arrived at between
the ancient system of frankpledge and the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>modern plan of employing a professional class of
peace officers, and how, by means of the combined
action of police and public, domestic tranquillity
was assured. Had it been possible to have made
this co-operation complete and thorough, the resulting
security would have left little to be desired;
but, as was only to be expected, discord not infrequently
took the place of harmony, and freemen
sometimes forgot what was due to the oath they
had taken. Let the events of a certain night
in Canterbury serve as an illustration. Some
watchmen, it appears, challenged a man whom
they found abroad "out of due time" and inquired
his business, but (to continue the story verbatim)
"the suspect person gave none answer, but ran
from thence into St Austin's liberty, and before
the door of one John Short they took him. And
the same John Short came out of his house with
other misknown persons and took from the said
watchmen their weapons, and there menaced them
for to beat, contrary to the oath of a true and
faithful freeman."<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>According to the strict letter of the law it was
a constable's duty, immediately after making an
arrest, to deliver his prisoner to the sheriff; but,
as a matter of fact, this was seldom done, and the
sheriff had little or nothing to do with accused
persons until after their conviction. In the absence
of proper lock-ups the village stocks were commonly
used by the parish constable to secure his man until
he could conveniently bring him before a magistrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>but, as time went on, confinement in the stocks
became the normal mode of punishment for minor
offences, and it was no rare thing for a constable
to keep a troublesome parishioner in this uncomfortable
custody for a space, on his own initiative
and responsibility.</p>

<p>Prisons had existed in some form or other from
the earliest times. The first dungeon was doubtless
coeval with the first fortress, and London's great jail
at Newgate dated back to the twelfth century. But
it was not then a penal establishment in our sense
of the term, in so far that imprisonment was hardly
as yet the recognised punishment for the ordinary
run of criminals; such places were rather convenient
strongholds in which to confine debtors till they paid
their dues, suspected persons till they confessed their
crimes, Jews till they disgorged their wealth, and
generally for the safe-guarding of political opponents
or private enemies whom it was desirable to keep
under lock and key. It was not until the fifteenth
century that we find a regularly graduated connection
between punishment by imprisonment and
punishment by fine; the penalty for drawing a
sword in the City of London, for example, was then
half a mark or fifteen days, for inflicting a wound
with the same, twenty shillings or forty days, and
so on.</p>

<p>The pillory was a more serious affair, and its
pains were beyond the power of a constable to
inflict; it was generally resorted to in cases where
the offender had been guilty of practices which rendered
him particularly obnoxious to the people, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>that the punishment he received at their hands was
nicely proportioned to the degree of unpopularity he
had earned for himself. The baker who gave short
weight, or the dairyman who watered his milk, received
such a lesson at the hands of his customers
that he was little likely to repeat his offence. It
was customary, moreover, in sentencing a man to
the pillory, to make the punishment fit the crime
as much as possible, and to compel the culprit to
advertise his guilt in some personally unpleasant
fashion; thus, the man who had stolen a cart was
forced to pull it through the streets to the place of
punishment, and an offending vintner had to drink
a full draught of the sour wine that had disagreed
with the frequenters of his shop.</p>

<p>Englishmen are proverbially interested in what
they eat and drink, and this public concern for good
victualling explains why, when life and property were
as yet but moderately secure, safeguards against the
adulteration of human food were notably complete.
The chief legislative authority upon which police
action, directed against dishonest purveyors, rested,
was the "Judicium Pillorie," or, as it is commonly
called, "The Statute of the Pillory and
Tumbrel."<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> This Act belonged to the same period
as the Statute of Winchester (both dating from the
latter half of the thirteenth century), and like its
more famous contemporary had a long career of
practical usefulness in the public service. From
1266, the year of its enactment, until 1710, the
date of its repeal, the Judicium Pillorie did much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>for English food, by maintaining a high standard in
the quality of our meat and bread, and in the
soundness of our ale. The Statute requires that
"they have in the town a pillory of convenient
strength as appertaineth to the liberty of their
market, which they may use (if need be) without
bodily peril either of man or woman." Provision
is made for the sending of six "lawful men" to
collect all the measures of the town, care being
taken that the owner's name is legibly inscribed
on each measure, "after which thing done" a jury
of twelve lawful men have to make oath that they
will truly answer concerning such things as may be
demanded of them on the King's behalf, "and such
things as be secret, they shall utter secretly and
answer privately," also, "if any butcher do sell contagious
flesh, or that died of the murren, or flesh
that hath been kept so long that it loseth its natural
wholesomeness, or meat bought from Jews and then
sold to Christians"&mdash;for these and similar offences
the penalty is the same, viz.: "If a baker or a
brewer be convict ... then he shall suffer punishment
of the body&mdash;that is to wit&mdash;a baker to the
pillory and a brewer to the tumbrel."</p>

<p>From "Liber Albus" we get a more detailed account
of the fashion in which these exemplary punishments
were carried out in London, we learn that "if any
default be found in the bread of a baker in the city,
the first time, let him be drawn upon a hurdle from
the Guildhall to his own house through the great
street where there be most people assembled, and
through the great streets which are most dirty, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>the faulty loaf hanging from his neck: if a second
time he shall be found committing the same offence,
let him be drawn from the Guildhall through the
great street of Cheepe, in the manner aforesaid, to
the pillory, and let him be put upon the pillory, and
remain there at least one hour in the day; and the
third time that such default shall be found, he shall
be drawn, and the oven shall be pulled down, and the
baker made to forswear the trade in the city for
ever."</p>

<p>Before leaving this part of the subject, it may be
worth mentioning, that as long ago as the year 1318<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
all public officers in city and borough were debarred
from selling wine or victual during their term of
office, a prohibition which some people think might
with advantage be applied at the present day to such
modern officials as the members of Borough Watch
Committees.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>COMMERCIAL POLICE AND POLICE UNDER THE
TUDORS</small></h2>


<p>The growth of the royal power that was so well
defined a characteristic of the sixteenth century
was accompanied by a general re-establishment of
good order throughout the kingdom. As long as
the reins of government were slackly held by feeble
monarchs, the king's peace was reckoned of but
little account, and in the words of the Anglo-Saxon
writer already quoted, "every man that could, forthwith
robbed another." Nobles surrounded by their
retainers, broke the peace whenever they chose, and
laid their hands on any property that they felt strong
enough to hold. As long as punishment overtook
the man who had offended against a great noble
with more precision and with greater celerity than it
did the offender who had broken the law of the land,
guardians of the peace were despised, whilst peace-breakers
were admired by the multitude, if not
respected.</p>

<p>When Henry VII. came to the throne he resolutely
set himself to put an end to this state of affairs, and
to re-assert the personal ascendancy of the sovereign,
especially with regard to the maintenance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>peace. He was obviously unable to achieve this
object single-handed, for he had no army with which
to enforce his commands, and the mass of the people
were not yet thoroughly emancipated. Something
of course might be done by dividing the nobles into
separate factions, and then pitting one faction against
another, and these tactics he pursued with some
success; the class however to which in the end the
king had to look for assistance was the middle-class,
which was chiefly occupied with money-making,
which was inclined to resent any interference with a
pursuit at once so novel and so absorbing, and which,
at the same time, was beginning to cry out for
increased protection for its newly acquired wealth.
As it seemed worth while to purchase the goodwill
of the spokesmen of this powerful class, at the cost
of complying with their not unreasonable requirements,
the king was ready to meet them halfway, and
the police administration was modified accordingly.</p>

<p>The compulsory duty of serving as a constable,
argued the middle-class, was not only unprofitable
but a wicked waste of good time that might be
devoted to objects that paid better; and so the
system of deputy constable crept in. Hue and cry
was all very well, they said, for the agriculturist or
the villein; he could lay down his spade to join in
the pursuit with little detriment to himself; but it
was different in the case of the weaver or the
merchant, the former could not afford to leave his
loom nor the latter to lose a bargain; and so hue
and cry fell into desuetude. When property consisted
only of timber, cattle, and land, difficult things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>for a thief to remove, little protection was demanded,
but when valuable articles, all more or less portable,
became common, and when many kinds of fraud, all
more or less subtle, menaced both consumer and
producer, a better guarantee for security was asked:
and so the old-established trade-guilds adapted
themselves to the changed conditions, and introduced
new protective measures. These modifications
must now be examined in more detail.</p>

<p>It is doubtful at what date the custom first arose
of discharging the office of constable by proxy, but
certain it is that, in the Tudor period, instead of one
headborough responsible to the Crown for the maintenance
of the peace in Tything and Hundred, which,
as we have seen, was anciently the system, we find
two or more constables answerable to the Justices,
nominally employed by the year, but practically as
permanent deputies, performing duties delegated to
them in parish and township, and their services paid
for, not by the public at large, but by the individuals
whose deputies they were.</p>

<p>In some respects the change, which in all probability
was a gradual one, contributed to the
deterioration of the police administration, because
unfortunately a very indifferent sort of man was
almost invariably selected as deputy. Speaking of
constables, Bacon says they are "of inferior, yea, of
base condition, which is a mere abuse or degenerating
from the first institution, for the petty constables in
towns ought to be the better sort of residents in the
same, save that they be not aged or sickly, but of
able bodies in respect of their keeping watch and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>toil of their place"; and Blackstone says that considering
the class of man that commonly acts as constable,
it is just as well that he should remain in ignorance
of the powers that are entrusted to him by law.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the employment of deputies
was mischievous in its immediate consequences, the
rise of the custom marked a distinct stage in the
development that resulted in the freedom from
personal liability which, without prejudice to the
police administration, we now enjoy; it began to
be felt that the onerous and thankless position of
constable deserved remuneration, and that it was
more economical to delegate constabulary duties to
experts, than that every man should be compelled
to serve his turn in an office that interfered with
his normal activity, and for which, perhaps, he had
no special aptitude. England, as we have seen, was
rapidly becoming a commercial country, and all were
eager to take advantage of every chance of money-making
that offered itself, and finding that the
duties of citizenship absorbed more of their time
than they were willing to spare, peace-officers were
no sooner elected than they hastened to hire any
proxies whom they could persuade to undertake the
burden of office. This reluctance of busy men to
devote their valuable time to an unpaid public
service was reasonable enough, and the practice of
employing substitutes was winked at by the authorities;
yet centuries passed before a way was found to
organize with intelligence, and officially recognize a
system, that whilst freeing the mass of the people
from an unnecessary conscription, should yet retain the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>essential principle that every man shares in, and
cannot divest himself of, a definite responsibility for
the maintenance of good order in the commonwealth.</p>

<p>The decay of the feudal system and the gradual
abolition of villenage went hand in hand, as we
have seen, with the rise of the merchant and the
artisan; as trade increased and as the skilled workman
became a recognized power in the state, the
police horizon widened, new interests needed protection,
new laws and regulations had to be made
and enforced. The supreme direction of commercial
police rested with the Crown; and, as long as the
sovereign's prerogative was confined to the control
of fairs and ports, to the granting or withholding of
monopolies, and to the regulating of weights and
measures, the services of the Justices of the Peace,
assisted by their constables, had been found sufficient
for all practical purposes. But when questions
arose, touching our trade with foreign merchants or
demanding a technical knowledge of native manufactures,
it became necessary to submit these
difficult problems to some more expert authority
than the ordinary executive officer. This want
was supplied, to a great extent, by the above-mentioned
police development of the Trade-Guilds
or Livery Companies, which, recently deprived of
much of their former political influence, now for the
first time seriously began to devote themselves to
the special interests of their several trades, by
properly confining their energies to channels more
legitimate than state-craft, such as the protection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>and control of the various markets, manufactures,
and handicrafts.</p>

<p>In the early stages of its development in this
country, commerce stood on a very different footing
from that upon which it rests to-day: skilled
artizans came and settled in England from all parts
of the continent, bringing their laws and customs
with them; arrived here, they not only competed
with the native manufacturer, but beat him at all
points of the game. In the absence of any preventive
police worth mentioning, the position of these
aliens would have been an impossible one, except
for two considerations; in the first place they
thoroughly recognised the value of combination and
acted upon it, and in the second place the very
considerable revenue that their activities brought to
the royal coffers, secured for them the king's protection
and support.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>This incursion of foreigners was not without its
effect on our craftsmen, who saw, that to command
success, they too must combine, organize, and
regulate. The result was that nearly every trade
and industry soon had its guild organized on the
continental model, the object of which (unlike the
modern trades-unions that exist mainly to prevent
the power of the capitalist over his employées from
becoming absolute), was to create a monopoly, and
hedge it round so that no outsider could enter the
exclusive circle without being properly initiated and
regularly admitted to craft-membership.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>The Livery Company punished the fraudulent
workman, corrected the idle apprentice, and also
prosecuted the would-be interloper who attempted
to infringe upon its rights and privileges.</p>

<p>We are indebted to these trade-guilds for introducing
to our shores in the first instance, many
mechanical arts which, greatly to our advantage,
subsequently became naturalized, and afterwards for
keeping them alive through times of difficulty and
danger, when the central government was not strong
enough to afford much protection; the high character
that English goods have earned throughout
the world's markets is, to a great extent, owing to
this system of commercial police, which compelled
every workman to serve a long apprenticeship in a
technical school, and which punished the producer of
fraudulent and worthless articles. On the other
hand whole fields of industry were arbitrarily closed
to honest and capable folk by the absurd restrictions
imposed for the sole benefit of corporations,
which, when full allowance has been made for the
good they did, and when full credit has been given
for the service they rendered by standing in the
breach at the critical moment, were, after all,
thoroughly reactionary in their tendency, bent, as
they were, upon stifling healthy competition whenever
possible, and inclined to look upon any new
invention as a crime against their craft mysteries.</p>

<p>A serious defect in the constitution of our
mediæval police consisted in the numerous privileges
enjoyed by favoured communities. No police
regulation was of universal application; we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>seen how in Anglo-Saxon times the king's peace
afforded especial protection to certain classes, and
how various limitations were imposed according to
locality and according to season; subsequently
charters were freely given to monasteries, guilds,
boroughs and cities, carrying rights and conferring
favours that were not shared by the nation at large.
The consequence was that every rule bristled with
exceptions, and legislation grew proportionally more
complicated and difficult of application than would
have been the case had all men been equal in the
eye of the law. Many a useful measure was
rendered largely inoperative by reason of the
numbers of persons who could plead privilege against
its enforcement in their particular case. Hue and
Cry could avail nothing against the baron who had
bought a charter of pardon for felonies committed in
the past or contemplated in the future, and the
pursuit of the sheriff was stayed when the fugitive
took refuge in sanctuary. First the clergy, and afterwards
persons not in orders who could prove their
ability to read a word or two in the Gothic character,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
were entitled to plead "benefit of clergy,"
and thereby escape perhaps well-merited punishment.
In the reign of Henry VII. this privilege
was wisely restricted, by ordaining that those who
had pleaded "clergy" once, should be branded on
the brawn of the thumb with a hot iron (M for a
Murderer, T for a Thief), so as to prevent their
cheating justice a second time by means of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>same plea. Gradually benefit of clergy was taken
away from one offence after another, until at last<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
no serious crime was left to which this exemption
from punishment attached. Again, the scholars of
Oxford and Cambridge were not subject to many
regulations that applied elsewhere, the members of
these universities being allowed to beg, under certain
restrictions, without incurring the penalties that
ordinary "vagabonds and sturdy beggars" were
liable to; on the other hand Jews and gypsies were
subject to pains that did not attach to the native
population.</p>

<p>The confusion of the illiterate constable, called
upon to act when confronted with a medley of contradictory
charters, passports and privileges, can well
be imagined, and, needless to say, personation and
forged certificates were largely resorted to both
by the habitual criminal and by the professional
beggar.</p>

<p>A very necessary reform introduced in this reign
was that which, in cases of homicide, made the trial
of the accused follow immediately upon the discovery
of the offence. By long-established usage,
originating from the time when the blood-feud was
the recognised agency for avenging murder, the
custom had arisen of postponing royal interference
until the relatives or friends of the deceased had
been allowed ample time in which to bring the
criminal to justice, and, by ancient consent, those
parties who were interested acted the rôle that our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>police detectives are now charged with, and, so to
speak, had to "get up" the case against the alleged
offender. An "Appeal," as it was called, was then
made before the Coroner and by him publicly
declared at five consecutive county-courts. It had
been laid down in 1277,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> that homicides should not
be proceeded against at the King's suit until a year
and a day had elapsed since the commission of the
murder, and in 1482,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> twelve months was declared
to be the privileged period in which appellors alone
might formulate an accusation. The natural result
(to quote the Statute,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> which did away with these
out-of-date restrictions) was, that "the party is
oftentimes slow, and also agreed with, and by the
end of the year all is forgotten, which is another
occasion of murder."</p>

<p>The anxiety to make money that pervaded all
classes, but which was especially observable in the
middle class, besides influencing the status of the
constable and making the guild such a prominent
feature of the time, was to a large extent responsible
for the increasing rigour of the criminal law. The
claims of property were urged to the uttermost, and
people who had anything to lose pressed for the
infliction of exemplary punishment in all cases
where the rights of ownership were threatened.
The result of this attitude was, that the war of
extermination against those who had no visible
means of subsistence was waged more relentlessly
than ever before. The dissolution of the religious
houses, following upon the civil commotions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>previous century, had multiplied the number of
vagrants until the country was full of homeless and
starving wanderers, many of whom, needless to say,
maintained themselves by robbery. Bad government
first created this dangerous class, and then
attempted to exterminate it by wholesale hanging:
it is said that more than 70,000 persons were put
to death during the thirty-eight years of Henry the
Eighth's reign; from this number a considerable
reduction may be made for exaggeration, and of the
remainder a large proportion suffered on religious
and political grounds. But the general government
was rigorous in the extreme, and, the value of human
life being but little accounted of, a penal system
grew up which exacted the death penalty for offences
of a comparatively trivial nature, thus laying the
foundations of the barbarous code which continued
to disgrace our Statute book for centuries, vainly
endeavouring to supply the place of preventive
police by repressive measures that were expected
to deter by virtue of their extreme severity. Sir
Thomas More saw the uselessness of such a policy,
and pointed out in his "Utopia," that as robbers
often killed their victims on the principle that
dead men tell no tales, it would be desirable, therefore,
to reduce the punishment for theft in order
to check the frequency with which murders were
committed.</p>

<p>Wales and the Welsh borderland had long been
the refuge of the outlaw, and the fastness of the
robber; for whilst the natural features of the country
favoured the escape of the fugitive from justice, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>division of the principality into independent lordships,
from which the king's writ was excluded, still
further increased the difficulty of arrest. At one
time there were 141 of these lordships, under as
many petty chieftains known as Lords-Marchers,
who indiscriminately sold charters, and harboured
any lawbreaker who would pay for his footing.
This kind of home-rule in Wales was incompatible
with the maintenance of order in the West of
England, and the counties near the border suffered
severely for their proximity to this Alsatia. Accordingly
in 1536 it was decided to extinguish the
separate jurisdiction of the Lords-Marchers, and the
whole of Wales was incorporated into England by
an Act passed in the 27th year of Henry the Eighth,
which provided Justices-of-the-Peace, Justices-of-the-Quorum,
and Justices-of-Gaol-delivery for the Welsh
counties, armed with the same power and authority
that the corresponding Justices in England were
possessed of; shortly afterwards (1543)<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> these newly-appointed
Justices of the Peace were authorised to
select two "substantiall gentlemen, or yeomen, to be
chiefe constables of the hundred wherein they inhabite,
which two constables in every hundred shall
haue a speciall regard to the conseruation of the
King's Peace."</p>

<p>A somewhat similar state of unrest existed in the
neighbourhood of the Scottish border. Here the
simple expedient of incorporation by Act of Parliament
was of course impossible, so in the following
year Henry instituted a Court, called the President
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>and the Council of the North, and empowered it to
preserve the peace, in that part of the realm, in the
king's name; so that "his true subjects ... have
undelayed justice daily administered."</p>

<p>Nearer home, Thomas Cromwell, acting for the
king, overhauled the administration of police, and
amongst other improvements established parochial
registers of births, marriages and deaths,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> but he was
too fond of thrusting petty and vexatious regulations
down the throats of a people, who, recently freed
from their old bondage, were now for the first time
beginning to think for themselves; his whole system
moreover was vitiated by the frequency with which
he employed spies and informers, a method of police
control always peculiarly abhorrent to the English.</p>

<p>The law against vagrancy, which, as we have seen,
was extremely severe during the preceding reigns,
reached its most barbarous stage soon after the
accession of Edward the Sixth. It is the irony of
circumstance which associates the name of so mild a
prince with one of the most atrocious measures ever
imposed upon Englishmen, for Edward was but a
child when the Statute in question was passed, and can
have had no hand either in the inception or application
of its provisions.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The responsibility belongs to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>the Protector, Somerset, yet it will always remain a
mystery how he could sanction such a measure, for
he is well known to have felt much sympathy for the
masses of his countrymen, and was ever anxious to
please. After remarking in the preamble that "idle
and vagabond persons are worthy of death, whipping,
imprisonment, and other corporal pain," the Statute
proceeds to enact that "the offender there described
to be an idle person shall be taken before a Justice
of the Peace, who shall cause him to be marked with
a hot iron in the breast, the mark "V," and adjudge
him to be a slave to the person presenting him for
two years, to be fed with bread and water, and be
put to work (how vile soever it be) by beating,
chaining, etc.: and if he runs away, the Justice, on
conviction, shall cause such slave to be marked on
the forehead or ball of the cheek with the sign of an
"S," and shall further adjudge him to be his master's
slave for ever:<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and if he again run away, he shall
suffer death as a felon."<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> No record tells how many
unfortunates suffered the pains above recited, but the
number is not likely to have been considerable,
because vagabondage was by no means stamped out:
the conclusion is forced upon one, however, that
whilst law-making of such a type was in vogue, the
infirmity of the police, whose business it was to enforce
its enactments, cannot be considered as an
unmitigated evil.</p>

<p>The grandmotherly domestic policy of the time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>which told people what they were to eat, how they
were to dress, and the number of hours they must
labour, resulted, as all such attempts to interfere with
the natural laws of supply and demand must result,
in serious conflict between the authorities and the
people, who sooner or later are sure to resent coercion,
and have recourse to violent resistance to obtain
economic freedom for themselves and their descendants.
Dissatisfaction had long been dormant, but
matters came to a head early in the reign of Edward
VI.; popular risings took place simultaneously all
over the country, the most serious outbreaks occurring
in counties as far remote from each other as
Cornwall in the West, and Norfolk in the East.
There was no machinery in existence for the suppression
of riots, no standing army, and no civil
power in any way adequate to meet force with force:
the executive was well-nigh powerless. Under these
circumstances a penal statute<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> against unlawful
assemblies was passed, much of which survives in
our present Riot Act now in force. It became high
treason for twelve or more persons, being assembled
together, to attempt to alter any laws, etc., or to
continue together for the space of an hour after
being commanded by a Justice of the Peace to
depart. It was made felony for twelve or more
persons to "practice to destroy a park, conduit, or
dovehouse," to pull down houses, barns, or mills,
to burn any stack of corn, or to abate the price of
victuals; or being assembled, to continue together
an hour, after being ordered in like manner to depart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>To make this statute effectual, it was necessary to
devise some new executive to enforce its provisions;
accordingly in each county a high official called the
Lord-Lieutenant was appointed, who was authorized
to levy men and lead them against the enemies of
the king, to which category rioters, as being guilty of
High Treason, were now specifically declared to belong.
With the appointment of Lords-Lieutenant,
the last of the military functions exercised by the
Sheriff passed out of his hands into those of the new
official, who to this day retains a remnant of authority
over the regiments of Yeomanry and Militia of his
county.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Until the middle of the sixteenth century any
person so inclined<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> could keep an alehouse&mdash;there
were no licensing laws and no excise-duty leviable
on alcoholic beverages, which indeed, remained
untaxed until 1643. Police control was therefore
both difficult and unpopular. A first attempt to
grapple seriously with this rapidly increasing mischief
was made in 1552,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> when Justices of the
Peace and Constables were given powers, which, it
was hoped, would do something to "remedy the
intolerable hurt and trouble to the Commonwealth
of the Realm" by "common alehouses and other
houses called Tipling-houses." To this end Justices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>were authorized "to remove and put away ... the
common selling of Ale and Beer" as they might
see fit. Henceforward only houses "admitted and
allowed in the open Sessions of the Peace" were to
be used for the sale of liquor, and Justices were
furthermore instructed to take bond and surety of
the occupiers; "for which recognizance, the party
so bound shall pay but 12 pence." Alehouse
keepers who should fail to comply with these conditions
might be committed to gaol by the Justices
of the Peace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>ECCLESIASTICAL POLICE AND POLICE UNDER
JAMES I</small></h2>


<p>The accession of Queen Elizabeth inaugurated
a period of great activity for the police
departments. Her rule was masterful and her
control maternal. Magistrates and constables were
kept busy in administering the statutes dealing
with apprentices, wages, disputes in service, hours
of labour, the regulation of industrial trades, laws
for the suppression of rogues and vagabonds, and
other enactments too numerous to mention, which
followed each other in quick succession. Of the
many statutes, public and private, passed in this
reign, having for their object the enforcement of
government by police, amongst the most important
were those which referred to the City and Borough
of Westminster, "for the suppressing and rooting
out of vice there used." The police administration
of the city had from time immemorial rested with
the ecclesiastical authorities, and in 1559 the Queen
gave a charter to the Dean and Chapter, carrying
the same privileges, immunities and powers, that the
Abbot and Convent used to enjoy. The Dean and
Chapter delegated their authority to a functionary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>called the High Steward, and made him responsible
for the preservation of the peace, but they conferred
upon him no power of levying money on the inhabitants
for that purpose, and made no provision
for the appointing of assistants to help him in his
duties. The result of this policy was continued
disorder, and after twenty-five years of failure, a
change of system was decided upon. In 1584<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
Westminster was divided into twelve wards, each
under a Burgess, who was nominated by the Dean
or High Steward, and these twelve Burgesses, as
well as the superior officers, were authorized to
punish "incontinences, common scolds, inmates, and
common annoyances" in accordance with the laws
and the customs of London. They had the power,
also, to commit to prison peace-breakers, but they
were bound to give notice of such committals to a
Justice of the Peace for Middlesex within twenty-four
hours. It was hereby further enacted that
"if any person or persons, after he or they shall
happen to be punished and banished from this city
for any incontinency of life or such like, and shall
return again to the city or borough, to the intent
there to inhabit and dwell, that then every such
person and persons shall be whipped naked at the
cart's tayle throughout the said city, for every time
so offending, contrary to this order."<a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Lord Burleigh was the first High Steward appointed
under this Act, and on his initiative certain
ordinances<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> for the better government of the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>of Westminster were added in the course of the same
year. These regulations were as minute as they
were varied. Not more than one hundred ale-houses
were allowed, which taverns were bound to display
a lantern with candle complete at their street-doors
"every night, nightly (except those nights as the
moon shall then and at that time shine and give
light) upon paine to forfeit and pay for every time
offending herein fourpence." Fourpence was in like
manner the fine imposed on those burgesses and
their assistants who failed to attend Divine Service
at the Abbey on Sunday, but the owner of any hogs
found wandering in Tuthill were mulcted in the sum
of twelve pence. It would be interesting to learn
the basis of these computations, and why a wandering
hog cost the owner as much as three absences
from morning prayer. More valuable, however, were
the regulations introduced with the object of preventing
the sale of bad and unwholesome food.
Special officers, called Searchers, "discreet men having
a knowledge of the trade," were appointed to
look after the butchers, poulterers, and provision
purveyors, with power to seize and burn bad meat,
and to commit the owners (or their agents exposing
food unfit for consumption), to prison, for a period of
twenty-four hours. The licensing of ale-houses still
rested with Justices of the Peace, and constables who
neglected to apprehend "sturdy beggars" were liable
to a fine of six shillings and eightpence.</p>

<p>In addition to the extra work thrown on their
shoulders in connection with the Acts above mentioned,
the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>was extended so as to encroach upon territory that
had hitherto been the province of the Justice of
Assize. Courts Leet, moreover, having by this time
become quite unimportant, the appointment and control
of the constabulary was centred almost entirely
in the hands of the county magistrates. They held
office under the Crown direct, and on their Commission
took an oath to do equal right between rich
and poor, to accept nothing beyond the customary
fees for the performance of their duties, and to pay
all fines inflicted by them into the Queen's Exchequer
without embezzlement or delay. "The Justices of
the Peace," writes Sir Thomas Smith, "be those in
whom, at this time, for the repressing of robbers,
thieves, and vagabonds, of privy complots and conspiracies,
of riots and violences and all other misdemeanours
in the commonwealth, the prince putteth
his special trust ... and generally, as I have said,
for the good government of the shire, the prince
putteth his confidence in them."<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the duties laid upon the rural police for
the control of agriculture, we find that before a
labourer "retained in husbandry" could leave his
parish or township, he had to obtain a testimonial
from the constable, and to get two householders to
declare his lawful departure.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> This system of passports
for the suppression of vagrancy never worked
smoothly, and its development in later times as
enforced against beggars by parish constables, led
to serious abuses that will demand our attention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>further on.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The 15th section of the same Act empowered
Justices and constables, upon request being
made during harvest time, to compel labourers to
work on farms where labour was scarce, and to put
those who obstinately refused in the stocks for two
days and one night.</p>

<p>The treatment served out to rogues, vagabonds,
and sturdy beggars was more severe. Persons taken
begging or "misordering themselves" were to be
committed to the common gaol, and if convicted of
the offence at the next sessions of the peace or gaol-delivery&mdash;"grievously
whipped, and burnt through the
gristle of the right ear with a hot iron of the compass
of an inch about."<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The burning was repealed, and
open whipping "until his or her body be bloody"
was afterwards substituted.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Although the severity
of the punishment was thus mitigated, it was now
apparently inflicted in a more summary fashion, for
offenders were no longer to be committed to gaol,
but were to be whipped on apprehension, probably
by the constables at the instance of a Justice.</p>


<p class="mt2">Up to this point the history of the constable is
one long record of new duties undertaken, and fresh
responsibilities incurred (though perhaps unwillingly),
by that officer. This tendency, as we shall see, becomes
more pronounced as time goes on, though
in one particular, the contrary may be noticed. In
1601, the famous Poor Law of Elizabeth<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> sensibly
relieved the parish officer of much irksome responsi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>bility
by associating with him churchwardens to help
in assessing the poor-rate, and to assist in the general
duty of supervising the needy. From this date until
1849 (when the Essex Rural Constabulary were first
employed as assistant relieving officers for casuals)
the care of the impotent poor was entrusted to
overseers specially appointed for the purpose, with
the result that constables had more leisure to make
things unpleasant for the vagrant man and the sturdy
beggar.</p>

<p>Hue and Cry remained the only practical agency
for the pursuit and capture of delinquents. The
method of its application, by whom it was to be
made, and the penalties that followed upon its
neglect, are fully dealt with in an Act passed
during the 27th year of this reign,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> which declares
that Hue and Cry is to be deemed lawful only
when made by Horsemen and Footmen, "any usage
or custom to the contrary notwithstanding." It is
not clear what is meant by this restriction, but it is
probable that the prohibition of man-hunting with
the aid of dogs was intended. In cases where the
fugitive was not apprehended, and where the inhabitants
responsible for the capture refused to pay
the amercement, the constables and headboroughs
were authorised to distrain upon the goods and
chattels of the obstinate parishioners, and to hand
over the money realized by the sale thereof to the
Justices.<a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The system pressed hardly on certain Hundreds,
which owing to their situation and local circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>stances,
were unable to apprehend all the peace-breakers
of the neighbourhood, and which were often
so poor that a heavy fine meant ruin to one or more
families in the group. We find in consequence that
petitions against amercements were not uncommon:
in 1597, for instance, the poor inhabitants of Benhurst
in Berkshire had to appeal to the clemency of
the Queen on account of the constant penalties
imposed on them, some at least of which they
thought should be borne by the neighbouring town
of Maidenhead. The language in which this appeal
is couched is so quaint and pitiful that their own
words are given. "That whereas the said Hundred
doth consist only of five small villages and three
small Quillets or Hamlets, and hath lying through it
two great highways: the one leading from London
to Henley-on-Thames and the other from London to
Reading: and either of them at the least three miles
in length within the Great Woody Ground called
the 'Thicket'&mdash;and no-one of the same villages
standeth upon or adjoining to either of the said
ways, but lie dispersedly far from the same: neither
have the inhabitants of the same Hundred any open
or common fields, either arable or other, adjoining or
lying near to such parts of the same ways (within
the said Thicket) as are most apt for robberies to be
done, whereby they may have their servants or workmen
labouring within the view of the said ways, to
take notice of the robberies done: and therefore the
said inhabitants cannot well have any speedy notice
or intelligence of any robbery which shall be there
committed unless the Party or Parties robbed should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>give the same unto them."<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> It is to the Queen's
credit that the inhabitants of Benhurst in Berkshire
did not appeal in vain to the royal clemency.</p>

<p>When in 1595 the civil arm was found insufficient
to put down the riotous proceedings that
disturbed the peace of the Home Counties, its
shortcomings were made good by the supplemental
employment of the military power. Elizabeth has
been accused of proclaiming Martial Law when its
application was not warranted by the exigencies of
the case.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> It is difficult for us at the present day
to determine how grave were the disturbances that
induced the Proclamation in question, or how far the
ordinary methods of control had been tried and
found wanting; but it is certain that no adequate
police existed to quell anything in the nature of a
serious riot. It was no doubt discreditable to the
Government that such should be the case, but it was
a discredit that it shared with all preceding Governments,
and one that attached with a greater degree
of culpableness to all subsequent Governments down
to the year 1829. Given an unlawful and violent
assembly of riotous persons, and the lack of any civil
force strong enough to disperse them, it is difficult to
see the practicability of any alternative measure to
that of calling out the troops. The Commission
given to Sir Thomas Willford in 1595 did not
amount to Martial Law in the usual acceptation of
the term, that is to say, the ordinary Law was not
to be entirely superseded, the Provost Marshal was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>only to "speedily execute" those offenders whom
the Justices of the Peace signified as deserving of
death, and such sentence was to be carried out in
the presence of the Justices who had had judicial cognisance
of the offence. The only additional powers
granted to Sir Thomas Willford were those by which
he was authorized to "repair with a convenient
company," and "calling to your assistance some
convenient number of our justices and constables
abiding about the said places, to apprehend all such
vagrant and suspected persons, and them to deliver
to the said justices, by them to be committed,"<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> etc.,
etc. The powers, in fact, given to the soldiers on
this occasion were solely executive; no one was to
be tried by Court-Martial; the verdict lay with the
civil power; and only the carrying out of the sentence
rested with the military authorities.</p>

<p>At no time of our history have the duties of the
Justice and the tasks of the constable been more
varied and onerous than they were at the period we
are considering. The jurisdiction and control of
these officers reached to the furthest corners of the
social edifice; they had to see that the labourers rose
betimes and did not take too long over their meals,
nor might the country parson marry without "the
advice and allowance"<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> of two Justices of the shire.
All these multifarious duties they performed for the
most part without pecuniary reward, the only fee to
which they were entitled being the sum of five shillings
for each day they sat in the execution of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>Statute of Labourers. On the whole it must be
allowed that they carried out the duties entrusted to
them both with credit to themselves, and to the
public advantage; for whilst Sheriffs, Under-Sheriffs,
and Bailiffs were for ever giving cause for complaint
on account of their "misdemeanour and evil behaviour,"
it was a rare occurrence for a Justice to
be accused of extortion or injustice, and crime was
far less common at this time than it afterwards
became. Contemporary writers, however, criticise
the county magistracy with some severity. Freak,
the Bishop of Worcester, for example, writes to the
Lord Treasurer in 1587, giving his opinion of the
Justices of the Peace: "I do observe some weakness
in that number: divers of them being but superficial,
either for advice or for execution of any weighty
affaires of the county," whilst Shakespeare is very
hard upon all police functionaries as he knew them.
Mr Justice Shallow, representing the Bench, Dogberry
and Verges of the Watch, as well as Elbow and
Dull of the Constabulary, are all treated with good-humoured
contempt. The dramatist's account of
the interview between Escalus and Elbow is of
particular interest because it illustrates the evils of
the system of deputy which clung to the office of
parish-constable until forty or fifty years ago.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The sort of difficulties that magistrates had to
contend with, owing to the slackness of the constabulary,
are graphically described in a letter dated
1596 in the course of which, Mr Hext, then a Justice
of the Peace for Somersetshire, complains officially to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>the Lord Treasurer that thieves and robbers had
grown so cunning, through having often been in
gaol, that these old hands could seldom be laid
hold of. "Others," he writes, "are delivered to
simple constables and tything-men, that sometimes
wilfully, and other times negligently suffer them to
escape." After suggesting that steps should be
taken to punish all keepers of ale-houses who
harbour suspicious persons, and all constables and
tything-men who suffer them to be at large, he
goes on to explain how difficult it is to get the
country people to prosecute in cases of theft, "for
most commonly the most simple country man and
woman, looking no further than to the loss of their
own goods, are of opinion, that they would not procure
any man's death for all the goods in the world."
This same reluctance to prosecute, as we shall see,
hindered the administration of justice for many generations,
and the question of how best to remove it, is
to this day a police problem, that has only been
partially solved by the comparatively recent institution
of the office of Public Prosecutor. Mr Hext
was either very credulous, or thieves' appetites must
have been prodigious in the sixteenth century, for in
the same letter he describes how "within this three
months I took a thief, that was executed this last
assizes, that confessed unto me, that he and two
more lay in an ale-house three weeks: in which
time they eat twenty fat sheep: whereof they
stole every night one." Finally he gives a woeful
account of the Egyptians (<i>i.e.</i> Gypsies) that infested
his county. "The inhabitants," declares the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>magistrate, "being wonderfully grieved by their
rapines, made complaint at our Easter Sessions,
after my Lord Chief Justice's departure: precepts
were made to the tythings adjoining for the apprehending
of them. They made answer, but (the
Gypsies) were so strong that they durst not adventure
of them: whereupon precepts were made to the
constables of the shire: but not apprehended, for
they have intelligence of all things intended against
them.... And they grow the more dangerous in
that they find they have bred that fear in Justices,
and other inferior officers, that no man dares call
them in question."<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>From all this it is clear that the police organization
left much to be desired. The country, in fact, was
not yet ripe for a good police. With the central
government corrupt, the superior courts venal, the
upper classes of society prone to violence, and the
masses for the most part unacquainted with justice,
the sixteenth century would have found a good police
force according to our standard, about as useful and
as easy of comprehension as they would an Edison's
phonograph or a modern treatise on the Spectrum
Analysis.</p>

<p>The police administration of the seventeenth century
differed but little from that which had gone before,
no real advance being discoverable either in the
theory or practice of peace-maintenance. Certain
changes were indeed taking place from year to year,
as old customs fell into disuse and as ancient words
acquired new meanings; but, on the whole, growth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>and decay were almost evenly balanced. If it is
admitted that the duties of a constable, and the
matters that fell within his province, were now more
clearly defined than heretofore, it must also be confessed
that he was permitted to shirk his work more
than ever. This slackness of performance may be
clearly demonstrated by a comparison between the
oaths taken by High and Petty Constables respectively,
on their appointment, and the copious evidences of
neglect that are everywhere apparent. Before his
admission to office an oath was administered to the
High-Constable-elect in these words:&mdash;"You shall
swear, That you shall well and truly serve our
Sovereign Lord the King in the Office of Constable.
You shall see and cause His Majestie's
Peace to be well and truly kept and preserved
according to your power. You shall arrest all
such persons as in your sight and presence shall
ride or go armed offensively, or shall commit or
make any Riot, Affray, or other Breach of His
Majestie's Peace. You shall do your best endeavour
(upon complaint to you made) to apprehend
all Felons, Barretors, and Rioters, or persons
riotously assembled: and if any such offenders shall
make resistance (with force) you shall levy Hue and
Cry, and shall pursue them until they be taken.
You shall do your best endeavour that the watch
in and about your Hundred be duly kept, for the
Apprehending of Rogues, Vagabonds, night-walkers,
Evesdroppers, Scouts, and other suspected persons,
and of such as go armed, and the like: and that
Hue and Cry be duly raised and pursued according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>to the Statute of Winchester, against Murderers,
Thieves, and other felons: and that the Statutes
made for the punishment of Rogues and Vagabonds,
and such other idle persons as come within
your bounds and limits be duly put in execution.
You shall have a watchful eye to such persons as
shall maintain or keep any common house or place,
where any unlawful game is or shall be used: as also
to such as shall frequent or use such places, or shall
use or exercise any unlawful games there or elsewhere,
contrary to the Statutes.</p>

<p>"At your Assizes, Sessions of the Peace, or Leet,
you shall present all and every the offences done
contrary to the Statutes made 1 Jacobi, 4 Jacobi,
and 21 Jacobi Regis, to restrain the inordinate haunting
and tippling in Inns, Alehouses, and other Victually
Houses, and for repressing of drunkeness: you
shall there likewise true presentment make of all
Bloudsheddings, affrays, outcries, Rescous, and
other offences committed or done against the
King's Majestie's Peace within your limits: You
shall once every year during your office present at
the Quarter Sessions all Popish Recusants within
your liberty, and their Children above 9, and their
servants, (<i>scil</i> their monthly absence from the
Church).<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> You shall well and duly execute all
precepts and Warrants to you directed, from the
Justices of the Peace of the County or higher
Officers: you shall be aiding to your neighbours
against unlawful purveyances: in time of Hay or
Corn Harvest, upon request, you shall cause all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>persons meet to serve by the day for the mowing,
reaping, or getting in of Corn or Hay: You shall in
Easter week cause your Parishioners to chuse Surveyors
for the mending of the Highways in your
parish or Liberty; and you shall well and duly,
according to your Knowledge, Power, and Ability,
do and execute all other things belonging to the
Office of Constable, so long as you continue in the
said Office. So help you God."</p>

<p>If the obligations here enumerated had been
effectually carried out, the King's Peace might
have been a reality instead of the meaningless
formula it had become; but High Constables were
not professional police-officers like our Chief Constables,
nor were they county magnates like the
High Constables who once had superintended the
police of the shire. The status of the office had
steadily declined: instead of the great noblemen
who, as we have seen, occupied similar posts under
the Plantagenet Kings, and instead of the "Yeomen
of the better class" spoken of by Lord Bacon, we
find ale-house keepers and petty tradesmen, hardly
less ignorant than the petty constables they were
supposed to instruct, undertaking the office for the
sake of profit, without any special aptitude, knowledge,
or experience of their important duties, and
without any serious intention of learning their
work; for as no inducement or encouragement
was held out to tempt or stimulate them to exertion,
they were as inefficient when they relinquished
their task as they were when they undertook it.</p>

<p>The form of oath required of petty constables,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>or Tything men, as they were still called, was as
follows&mdash;"You shall swear that you shall well
and truly execute the office of a Tythingman of
the Tything of H. (or headborough, etc.). His
Majestie's Peace in your own person you shall
keep, and see it kept in all others, as much as in
you lieth. In the presence of the High Constable
you shall be aiding and assisting unto him: and
in his absence you shall execute his office, and do
all other things belonging to your office, according
to your knowledge and Power, untill another be
chosen in your room, or you shall be legally
discharged thereof.&mdash;So help you God."</p>

<p>It is immaterial whether these police officers
deliberately took the required oath, meaning not to
be bound by it, or whether they were so ignorant as
not to understand the nature of a solemn affirmation;
but be this as it may, High Constables neglected
their oath and their office, and petty constables
followed suit, rarely acting at all except under
compulsion, or unless an opportunity offered for
some petty tyranny or extortion, whilst anything
like professional activity was quite unknown. Nor
was the prevailing stagnation the worst feature of
the times. The moral character, as well as the
social position of peace officers, Justice and constable
alike, deteriorated under Stuart misgovernment.
The King of course remained <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</i> the
"highest maintainer of the peace," and his weaknesses,
illegalities, and extortions were not only
repeated but multiplied in the descending links of
the chain of responsibility.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p>It was in the reign of James I. that corrupt
magistrates first earned for themselves the nickname
of "Basket Justices," as the predecessors of the
"Trading Justices" of later days were called; and
even the higher judges were not altogether above
suspicion. With such a degenerate personnel to
carry out its provisions, small wonder that the law
frequently became a dead letter. Let one instance
suffice. During this reign the right of sanctuary
was abolished by law; but custom, which was far
more powerful than the police, having decided
that sanctuaries should continue, not only was no
attempt made to deprive these asylums of their
ancient privileges, but certain of them, notably
Whitefriars, secured for themselves additional immunities.
The country, in fact, too often had to
witness the ridiculous spectacle of a Legislature
solemnly filling the Statute Book with elaborate
enactments, whilst the constables whose duty it
was to see the law enforced, were quietly going
about their own business, following the plough, or
minding the shop. English police was in truth at
a low ebb, and the inevitable consequences of such
a feeble executive quickly followed; bullies and
blackguards of every kind overran the realm, and
the weak had no rights except such as the strong
chose to leave them. "Private quarrels were
nourished" (writes the historian of the period)
"... and duels in every street maintained:
divers sects and peculiar titles passed unpunished
and unregarded, as the sect of the Roaring Boys,
Bonaventors, Bravadors, Quarterors, and such like,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>being persons prodigal, and of great expense, who,
having run themselves into debt, were constrained
to run next into factions, to defend themselves from
danger of the law. These received countenance
from divers of nobility: and the citizens, through
lasciviousness consuming their estates, it was like
that the number (of these desperadoes) would rather
increase than diminish: and under these pretences,
they entered into many desperate enterprises, and
scarce any durst walk in the Street after nine at
night.... Alehouses, dicing houses, taverns and
places of iniquity, beyond manner abounding in
most places."<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Slack as the police were in other directions, the
campaign against vagrants continued to be conducted
with vigour. All men, whatever their
station, were ordered to apprehend such rogues or
vagabonds as they might see begging, and to
convey them to the nearest constable or tythingman,
at whose hands they were liable to be branded
with the letter "R," should they be found incorrigible.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
Nor was this all. Justices of the Peace
were instructed to summon the constables together
some four or five days before the half-yearly sessions,
and to command them "to make a general privy
search one night for the finding out of such rogues
and idle persons, and such as they find they shall
bring to the Justices, and if for punishment (cause
them to be) conveyed to the house of correction,
there to be set to labour."<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> In order, moreover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>that this privy search might be the more effectual,
constables were empowered to claim the assistance
of as many neighbours as they might find sufficient
for their purpose.</p>

<p>Such persistent persecution of the vagrant class
does not argue that the police were efficient, for if
the vagrants had been organized or able to stand up
for themselves, there is little doubt that they would
have been left alone just as the Roaring Boys
and the Bonaventors were. This is also true, to
some extent, of those unfortunate persons who were
suspected of being afflicted with the plague, and who
were, in consequence, treated with as little consideration
as are pariah dogs in an Indian cantonment.
Fear of the plague aroused an unwonted display of
energy amongst police officers, and caused extraordinary
powers to be given to the Justices, who
were authorised to appoint Searchers, Watchmen,
Examiners, and others to see that no person suspected
of being infected left their houses. If any
such person, having been duly warned, "contemptuously
went abroad," the Watchmen might, with
violence, enforce him to keep his house, but if
he was caught in the public streets having any
infectious sore upon him uncured, he was adjudged
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i>" guilty of felony, and might be sentenced
to death. Furthermore, if any man was discovered
abroad "conversing with company" after being
cautioned to keep house, even if there was no sore
found about him, it was ordained that he should be
punished as a vagabond, and be subject to all
penalties for vagabondage (including whipping) be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>sides
being bound to his good behaviour for the
space of one year.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> In remote country districts
similar powers were conferred, not only on Justices
of the Peace, but also on constables and headboroughs.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The following police regulations, which were in
force during an outbreak of the plague in the
City of Oxford, are from a Proclamation by Charles
I. in the year 1644, and are far milder and more
reasonable than those considered necessary in the
previous reign, as a few extracts will shew. It
is ordained&mdash;"That a Watchman (be) set at the
Fore door of the house, to keep in the persons
within the house, and also to fetch them such
necessaries as they want, to be delivered to them so
discretely and warily as may not endanger themselves,
or those to whom they may resort.</p>

<p>"That when a house shall be known to be infected
with the plague, forthwith a Red Crosse be
set on the outward doore of the house, with an
inscription in Capital Letters, with these words
LORD HAVE MERCY UPON US.</p>

<p>"That every such Watchman, when he sitteth or
goeth in the streets, carry a white stick in his hand,
so that others may be admonished not to presse too
neare into his company.</p>

<p>"That all burialls of persons dying of the plague
be in the night-time, after tenne of the clock at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>soonest, and without concourse of people, and that the
Corpse be laid at least foure foot deep under the ground.</p>

<p>"That all Dogs and Cats in the Towne be forthwith
sent away out of the Towne, or such as are
found in the Streets, or Courts of the Colledges, to
be knockt on the head, and their carcasses carryed
away and buried without the Works at a convenient
distance."<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at if during the troubles
which befell the nation in King Charles' reign,
police suffered in common with all other institutions.
Internal peace was not likely to thrive during those
eleven years whilst no Parliament was summoned,
whilst Wentworth was devoting his energies towards
the creation of a standing army that was to make
the Crown absolute, whilst soldiers were billeted
broadcast on unwilling inhabitants, and as long as in
many districts martial law continued to supersede
the ancient judicial system.</p>

<p>The keynote of Charles' policy was, from the first,
a determination to raise money by hook or by crook,
wherever the cost might fall, and to this end, one
field of trickery after another was exploited. One
device (1626) was to make Sheriffs of those of his
opponents whom the King feared, so as to secure
their detention in their own counties; another was
an attempt (1640) to reintroduce the forest laws, by
determining afresh the boundaries of the royal
forests,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and re-insisting on their old-time privileges
for the sake of the revenues accruing therefrom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>Amercements were collected with an energy that
was not content until the uttermost farthing had
been gleaned: offences against the licensing laws
were usually punished by fines, and the income
arising from this source was not small, so it was
enacted,<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> that if offenders did not pay up within six
days, they were to be delivered to the constable to be
whipped, and if the constable failed to execute his
warrant, he was to be committed to prison by the
Justice until he should induce someone else to do it
for him.</p>

<p>Before approaching the subject of the Civil War
and its after-consequences, it will, perhaps, not be
out of place to pause for a moment, and looking
back on the history of the past, to enquire, how
much of the ancient police system of England survived
at this period, how much of it was dormant,
and what portions had altogether disappeared.</p>

<p>The Tything could no longer be said to exist: the
increase of population, the growth of trade, and the
improved facilities for moving from one part of the
country to another, having rendered the retention of
such a small sub-division impracticable. The parish
took the place of the tything, and the parish-constable
filled, to some extent, the position once held by the
tythingman. We have seen how the office of constable,
which theoretically ought to fall to all the
inhabitants in rotation ("Religious Persons, Knights,
Clerkes and Women" only excepted) came to be
generally executed by paid, and practically permanent
substitutes; but it must not be forgotten that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>the liability of the principal was not at an end,
nor the appointment of the substitute valid, unless
the transfer was approved by the inhabitants,
and until it was duly confirmed by the proper
authority.</p>

<p>The decay of frank-pledge, as a practical system,
had long been complete, but the general principle
remained, and now and again we come across
attempts at revival and other indications, which
prove that the Saxon régime was not entirely forgotten.
In his "Customs of the City of London,"
published in 1642, Sir Henry Colthrop quotes from
Liber Albus: "A large Charter is granted for the
liberties of Southwark, and for correction of offences
there, with a view of Franck-pledge with arrests, and
to bring the offenders to Newgate."<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Writing in the first half of the seventeenth century,
Minsheu says that "Inlaugh signifieth him that is in
some Franke-pledge," and goes on to remark that
"Decennier is not now used for the Chiefe man of a
Dozen, but for him that is sworn to the King's Peace ... and
that no man ordinarily giveth other securities
for the keeping of the King's Peace, but his owne
oath, and that therefore none answereth for another's
transgression, but every man for himself&mdash;and for the
generall ground this may suffice."<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The exceptions
here implied, refer no doubt to the custom of binding
over an offender to keep the peace. "Inlaugh" is
obviously the antithesis of the more familiar "Outlaw,"
whilst "Dozen" is used in its original sense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>"Ten," and has nothing to do with the number
"Twelve."</p>

<p>The liability of the Hundred to compensate the
sufferers for the damages done therein still held
good,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and constables had never been relieved, by
Statute or otherwise, of their constitutional duty of
presenting offences at the court of the Hundred or
Leet. The High Constable was the chief executive
officer of the Hundred, but as the scope of his office
has been fully set forth in the form of oath already
quoted, his exact position need not be further enlarged
on, except to say that his disciplinary powers over
the petty-constables seem to have been very limited.
The Justices decided what the petty-constables were
to do, and how they were to do it, despite the fact
that the High Constable was the man who was responsible
for the due conservation of the peace in his
district: he had, in short, most of the responsibilities
of a modern Chief Constable, with no power of
appointing, dismissing, or controlling his assistants.</p>

<p>The obligation of all to bear arms had been re-enforced
by Statute as recently as the year 1557,<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
and this liability remained the law of the land, at
least nominally so, until the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The Statute of Winchester defined the law as to
Watch and Ward as heretofore, and although of
course its precise regulations were no longer adhered
to in detail, but modified continually with the changing
circumstances of the times, no fresh authoritative
declaration was issued on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Hue and Cry, also, had undergone little change
and in 1626 is thus defined by Minsheu: "Hue and
Cry&mdash;This signifieth a pursuit of one having committed
felonie by the highway, for if the partie
robbed, or any in the companie of one murdered or
robbed, come to the Constable of the Next Towne,
and will him to raise Hiew &amp; Crie, or to make pursuit
after the offendour, describing the partie, and
shewing, as neere as he can, which way hee is gone:
the Constable ought forthwith to call upon the Parish,
for aid in seeking the felon: and if he be not found
there, then to giue the next constable warning, and
he the next, untill the offender be apprehended, or
at the least untill he be thus pursued to the
sea-side."</p>

<p>This brief survey of the police system of the early
Stuart period not only shews how little progress had
been made during the last five hundred years, but
partly explains the rash haste with which all classes
decided to appeal to the sword for the settlement of
the differences that divided Crown and Commons.
For some time back, in the absence of that restraining
influence which an efficient police force might
have afforded, people had readily run into factions;
and, with arms in their hands, had supported their
particular opinions by force, in defiance of all
authority, and with a degree of violence that
would never have been tolerated for a moment
in any community where the value of peace-maintenance
was duly appraised and properly
insisted upon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>MILITARY POLICE AND POLICE UNDER CHARLES II</small></h2>


<p>If the feebleness of the police was in some degree
responsible for the ready appeal to arms in
1642, the lawlessness that was so widespread at the
close of the century, was largely the outcome of the
disorganization of the national police system, which
was the natural accompaniment of the Revolution.
Civil War is invariably attended by an outbreak of
crime that has no connection with the main quarrel,
but which arises in the day of trouble because the
powerlessness of the executive is the opportunity of
the criminal. No longer is any one power supreme
(crimes committed in one camp being generally condoned
in the other), and a mania of insubordination
drives ordinarily well-disposed persons to throw off
the old restraints to which they instinctively submit
in times of peace. When Civil War begins, the
"King's Peace" is at an end, the Law is forgotten
or despised, the whole body politic is in a state of
fever, and the usual functions of orderly government
are suspended.</p>

<p>If the Revolution in England produced less serious
consequences than might have been expected, this
result was due to the puritan zeal of the Parlia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>mentary
Army, which had no sympathy with any
acts of violence that were not directed against those
whom it held to be the enemies of liberty and religion,
and which at least permitted no riotous licence
amongst its adherents. Yet in spite of this desire of
the popular party to maintain order, the whole civil
machinery of the country was dislocated and out of
gear as long as the war lasted; even the circuit of the
Justice of Assize was discontinued; and marriages,
no longer solemnised with the customary religious
ceremony, were performed by Justices of the Peace,
and in such a casual manner that few records were kept.</p>

<p>As soon as Cromwell's victory was complete he at
once set to work to establish an orderly government,
only to find that the old implements that had served
his predecessors were now broken and well-nigh useless.
In London, the Parliamentary stronghold, the
re-establishment of order presented no insuperable
difficulties, but in the rural districts the case was
different. There the gentry, to which class both
Justices of the Peace and grand jury-men belonged,
were in the main royalists&mdash;whilst constables, tythingmen
and petty jurymen were usually Roundheads.
The resulting friction hampered the Protector's administration
from the first; so that, much as he would
have preferred to have made use of the constitutional
machinery for peace-maintenance, he was often compelled
to resort to novel expedients to police the new
commonwealth. If it was denied to Oliver Cromwell
to govern on constitutional lines, he held, nevertheless,
the supreme command of a large and powerful army,
such as no sovereign in England had previously had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>the control of, and inevitably therefore, he fell back
upon the military forces that had served him so well
in the past, hoping by their aid to restore, if not to
improve upon, the state of security that had been
wrecked by the war.</p>

<p>An attempt to reform the county magistracy by
the creation of a new commission of the peace in the
year 1651 having ended in failure, the Protector had
no choice but to hand over to the Army those police
functions which no alternative organization was competent
to undertake, and so for the first time in
English history, the civil power was subordinated to
a military dictatorship, and for a while the sword
supplanted the baton.</p>

<p>In the course of the year 1655 the whole of
England and Wales was divided for administrative
purposes into twelve police districts, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>To each of these districts a military officer was
assigned, and largely endowed with inquisitorial and
penal powers. Though holding for the most part no
higher army rank than that of colonel or major, these
functionaries (who were appointed by Cromwell himself,
and who remained under his personal supervision)
were styled Major-Generals,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and under this title exercised
an office which for the moment overawed the
constitutional ministers of the peace. At first it was
not intended that the ordinary magistrates should be
superseded, for the Major-Generals were instructed to
co-operate with "the other Justices of the Peace," and
if in practice this co-operation degenerated into flat
coercion, such a result must be attributed to the
exigencies of the occasion, or to the misinterpretation
of their orders by the Protector's agents, rather
than to the deliberate design of Cromwell himself.</p>

<p>The programme in front of the military reformers
was a sufficiently extensive one, comprising, as it did,
measures "for the security of the peace of the nation,
the suppressing of vice, and the encouragement of
virtue."<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> To enable them to grapple with their
herculean task, they were assisted by a special force
of militia, 6420 strong, all but two hundred of whom
were mounted, and the expense of the new administration
was met by the imposition of a tax of ten per
cent. on the estates of Royalists, on the old English
principle that those responsible for disturbances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>should pay for the re-establishment of order. As
was only to be expected, political considerations
suggested many of the police regulations now enforced&mdash;travellers
from foreign parts were not free
to remain on English soil till they had communicated
to the Major-General of the district, their names, their
destination, and their business, nor were they allowed
to move from shire to shire without previously advising
the Justices; whilst ex-cavaliers and other persons
of known royalist sympathies were bound to notify
every change of address to the soldier-magistrates,
who were also empowered to disarm rebels and to
distribute the confiscated weapons amongst supporters
of the parliamentary cause. For the guidance of the
Major-Generals a document was circulated, containing
twenty-one headings, under which was set out a
scheme for the better government of the people&mdash;horse-racing,
cock-fighting, and bear-baiting were
forbidden, drunkenness, blasphemy and sabbath-breaking
were to be severely punished, and alehouses,
not absolutely necessary for the refreshment
of travellers, were to be suppressed.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The vigour
with which this crusade against popular sports was
pushed is well illustrated by the activity displayed
by Colonel Barkstead, who with his own hand
killed all the bears in Westminster, and ordered his
men to wring the neck of every game-cock that they
could find.</p>

<p>Under the military régime espionage was encouraged,
and the new functionaries received special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>instructions to watch carefully such persons as
appeared to live beyond their means. At the same
time better protection for the public highways was
provided, sheriffs being ordered to apprehend vagrants,
robbers and highwaymen throughout their respective
districts, with the assistance, if necessary, of the military
police; in this way the vagrant nuisance was
considerably abated, if not for long, and in one
neighbourhood at least complete success would seem
to have been attained, for Whalley was able to boast,
"This I may truly say, you may ride all over Nottinghamshire,
and not see a beggar or a wandering rogue."</p>

<p>Although the meshes of what the Protector called
his "little poor invention" were calculated to entangle
petty sinners amongst his opponents whilst admitting
of the escape of more dangerous offenders amongst
his adherents, it would be unjust to suppose that
Cromwell's police system was only a pretext for the
exercise of political tyranny. Many of the pains
suffered by royalists were directly attributable to
their own faults, and, without deserting their cause,
they might with ordinary care have avoided many of
the penalties they incurred. Generally speaking, the
code was especially severe against moral as contrasted
with criminal offences; gambling and profane swearing
being punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment,
whilst dissolute living rendered the offender
liable "to be sent out of the Commonwealth," as
transportation to Barbadoes was euphemistically
termed. In addition to their already too numerous
duties, the Major-Generals were expected to exercise
a general supervision over the religious habits of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>people, the regulations of weights and measures and
the control of certain trades also falling to their lot.
In London and Westminster, where the Puritans had
a preponderating majority, and where Major-General
Skippon and Colonel Barkstead respectively held
command, the police control grew particularly irksome
and irritating, puritan zeal being carried to such
a pitch that fiddlers found themselves in the stocks for
no worse offence than playing a jig, and even the
ordinary Christmas festivities were sternly repressed.
Search was frequently made in the taverns and alehouses,
and any servant or apprentice found there
after 8 P.M. was seized and taken before a Justice of
the Peace for punishment. The Commissioners of
Customs also were instructed to cause their officers
to make similar visits in order to prevent tippling
amongst watermen,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> whilst stage-plays and places of
public amusement were vigorously proceeded against.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>The régime associated with the Major-Generals
was short; these functionaries were practically
extinct before the end of 1657, and all traces of
their rule were quickly obliterated after the restoration
of the Monarchy. But the episode is none the
less interesting as being the only example in England
of an almost unqualified military police ascendancy,
such as has been common elsewhere.</p>

<p>In estimating the results produced by this system,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>it must be borne in mind that the circumstances
under which it was instituted were quite exceptional.
The army which undertook the policing of the country
was composed neither of foreigners nor of mercenaries;
on the contrary, its members were the pick of the
middle classes of England, and their object was the
maintenance of liberty and religion, as they understood
those terms, not conquest, nor oppression for
oppression's sake.</p>

<p>Cromwell's lieutenants did their work with honesty
and diligence, and, according to their lights, they held
the balance of justice level between man and man.
If their discretion had equalled their impartiality,
posterity would be able to look upon their administration
with unqualified approval, but the admonishing,
meddling, and eavesdropping tactics that they
saw fit to pursue only invited the reaction that so
quickly followed on the heels of their employment.</p>

<p>As long as a strict military discipline remained in
force, disorders were kept in check, but as soon as
it was relaxed, the havoc caused by the war soon
became apparent, and at no time in our history has
there been such a need of a strong and capable police
force as there was at the time of the Restoration.
The country was overrun by vagrants and disbanded
soldiery, numbers of people had suddenly been
reduced to poverty, and numbers had as suddenly
been raised to affluence; the revulsion of feeling
that followed upon the downfall of the puritan party
led to excesses of every kind, and licence and violence
thrived in the general confusion; nor was it till
Charles II. had been king for several years that any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>attempt was made to grapple with the state of chaos
to which the internal security of the kingdom had
been reduced, and even then the matter was not
faced with any resolution.</p>

<p>London was in a disgraceful condition. Few
towns in Europe were at once so inadequately
policed, so badly lighted, and in such an insanitary
state as the capital city of England; proof of the
lack of proper sanitation, and its unfailing result,
was brought home to people in convincing form at
the time when the nightly procession of dead-carts,
filled with victims of the plague, was the only traffic
to be seen in the streets; but although the great
fire of 1666 improved out of existence some of the
most pestilential quarters, London remained a city
of squalor and darkness. Most of the thoroughfares
were without pavements of any kind, and such as
existed were so sunken and broken that they were a
source of danger to those who stumbled along them;
rubbish was shot out of upper windows into the
street beneath, and the public squares were used as
receptacles for all the filth of the neighbourhood.
After nightfall the certainty of having to encounter
drunken bullies and highway robbers confined to
their houses those citizens whom urgent business did
not compel to walk abroad; even in daylight there
were districts where the peace officers dared not
venture, and Macaulay tells us that within the
sanctuary of Whitefriars "even the warrant of the
Chief Justice of England could not be executed
without the help of a company of musketeers."<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>All this time the legislature was mute: throughout
the reign of Charles II. hardly a single Act of
Parliament was passed dealing with the policing of
the twin cities that make up the metropolis. The
municipal authorities did what they could, and by
an Act of Common Council provided a force of
about one thousand Bellmen, afterwards called
Charlies, in memory of the monarch in whose reign
they were first instituted. Unfortunately these
watchmen were allowed to shirk their duties and
were well known to be altogether inefficient, so
much so, that when rowdy apprentices and other
unruly assemblages gave trouble, as they too often
did, no one thought of looking to such weak-kneed
officials for the safety of the town. On such
occasions companies of soldiers were requisitioned to
protect the main thoroughfares, and, as a further
precaution, chains were stretched from one side of
the street to the other to prevent the free movement
of the riotous bands.</p>

<p>Before the end of the reign, however, some advance
was made towards rendering London a fit
place to live in. Several squares were enclosed and
planted; new and wider streets were built; but the
greatest improvements of the time were due, not
to the efforts of municipal authorities, but to the
recently-formed Royal Society, which investigated
the question of sanitary police, and offered suggestions
that to some extent were acted upon, with the
result that England has since been free from the
plague, so fatal in former years. Commissioners
of Sewers were appointed, and the duties of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>scavengers and rakers, with regard to the cleansing
of the metropolis, were formulated.</p>

<p>In other departments also, progress was manifest,
especially in the lighting arrangements. By an act
passed in 1672<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> it had been ordered that a certain
number of candles should be displayed every night
between Michaelmas and Lady Day; but in 1685
private enterprise was responsible for placing a light
before every tenth door from dusk till midnight.
The effect cannot have been dazzling, but even this
moderate amount of illumination was more effectual
in preventing crime than any number of the watchmen
of the period were likely to be. About the
same time regulations for the control of hackney
carriages plying for hire were first published.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>In the rural districts peace-maintenance was, if
possible, at a lower ebb than in London&mdash;the roads
were almost impassable throughout the winter
months, and highwaymen were as frequent as mile-stones.
Peace officers were practically non-existent:
Justices were careless and apathetic, and Lords of
the Manor had neglected to hold Courts-Leet for
the annual election of Constables. A statute of
1673<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> complains of the lack of constables, and
authorises two Justices of the Peace in each district
to fill up the vacancies immediately. This was the
first occasion on which the power of appointing
petty constables had been by Act of Parliament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>conferred on the magistrates, and official sanction
extended to what had for years been the almost
invariable custom. For the better policing of highways,
turnpikes were established,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and those who
used the roads made to subscribe towards the
necessary repairs, instead of the whole burden being
thrown on the rural population, which, partly by
forced labour exacted by law (the <i>Corvée</i> of Feudal
times), and partly by a parochial rate, had been
compelled to mend the roads that traversed their
neighbourhood. It is to be feared that this long-delayed
act of justice was attributable rather to the
vile condition of the highways than to any tender
consideration for the rural population.</p>

<p>The system of passports, which had been introduced
some centuries before for the purpose of
checking vagrancy, continued to find favour, and
was believed in as a panacea for the prevention
of all kinds of crime. It was thought, not without
reason, that a thief could not long pursue
his vocation undetected amongst neighbours, who
were acquainted with his circumstances, and who
saw how he occupied his time and how he spent
his money, whilst a stranger who came to-day
and was gone to-morrow, might rob from one end
of England to the other with impunity. The police
were therefore instructed to enforce the regulations
against vagrants with increased vigour, and in the
following manner. After a vagrant beggar had been
whipped he was entitled to a testimonial signed by
the minister of the parish and countersigned by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>constable or tythingman, setting forth the date and
place of his punishment, something after this form.
"W. W., a sturdy vagrant beggar (aged about forty
years) tall of stature, red-haired, and long lean-visaged,
and squint-eyed, was this 24th day of A
in the 22nd year of the reign of Our Gracious
Sovereign Lord King Charles the Second, etc.,
openly whipped at T in the County of G; according
to the law, for a wandering rogue; and is
assigned to pass forthwith from parish to parish
by the officers thereof the next streight way to
W in the county of B, where he confesseth he was
born: and he is limited to be at W aforesaid
within twelve days now next ensuing at his peril.
Given under the hands and seals of C. W. minister
of T. aforesaid, and of J. G. constable there, the day
and year aforesaid."<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Any vagrant found by a
constable, and unable to produce such a testimonial,
was straightway to be arrested, and became liable to
more whipping, or if found incorrigible<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> to transportation
"to any of the English plantations beyond
the sea" by the order of a majority of Justices at
Quarter Sessions. Although we no longer look
upon vagrancy as "The Mother and Root of all
Evil" as our forefathers did, and have relaxed the
stringency of the laws against vagabondage, the
tramp is still an object of legitimate suspicion, and
a watchful eye is kept by the Convict Supervision
Office over all convicts at large, who are bound to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>produce their licenses when called upon by a police
officer to do so, and are only allowed to travel from
district to district under certain restrictions.</p>

<p>Among the many difficulties that those responsible
for the preservation of the peace had to contend
with, one of the most complicated was how best to
deal with the lawless aggression of the Lowland
Scots without involving the two nationalities in
actual war. Henry VIII. endeavoured to solve the
problem by the creation of a special local authority
called "The Council of the North," but this was
only a temporary measure, and not very successful,
nor were the expedients adopted by Elizabeth any
more effectual. Throughout the whole of the seventeenth
century, the northern counties were continually
overrun by predatory bands, called Moss-troopers,
who taking advantage of the almost perennial hostility
existing between the English and the Scots, harried
the country-side, murdering, marauding, and lifting
cattle: in case of pursuit, or after an unusually
successful expedition, they had only to cross the
border to avoid capture. According to Fuller,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
their numbers amounted at one time to some
thousands of men, who scoured the country in troops
and exacted an annual tribute from the inhabitants
of the valleys between the Solent and the North Sea.
Although Fuller's was assuredly an exaggerated
estimate, these enterprising freebooters were without
question a most formidable fraternity. The Union
of the Crowns of England and Scotland deprived
them, it is true, of the international pretext they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>had traded upon in the past, but their depredations
continued just the same as before. With the hope
of putting an end to these raids, a local police force
was established in 1672,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and afterwards kept alive
by successive Acts of Parliament. The Justices of
the Peace for the northern counties were empowered
by virtue of this Statute to make a charge of £500
against Northumberland, and of £200 against Cumberland,
for the payment and support of a body of
men, forty-two strong (viz., thirty Northumbrians
and twelve Cumbrians), whose duty it was to
"search out, discover, pursue, apprehend, and bring
to trial by law,"&mdash;the raiders. In strict justice, the
task of suppressing the Moss-troopers should not
have been left to a local force, but the political
relations between the two countries were already
strained almost to breaking point, and the employment
of troops on the borderland might, and probably
would, have induced a rupture. Under the
circumstances, therefore, the government of the day
was probably justified in the course pursued, but on
no account should the whole expense have been
borne by the very counties which had already
principally suffered through the inroads of the
raiders.</p>

<p>Contemporary literature shews how lamentably
insecure life and property had become in the days
of the later Stuarts, and during the early Georgian
period. Luttrell's diary is one long catalogue of
crimes of violence, and he remarks, from his own
experience, that "footpads are very troublesome in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>the evening on all the roads leading to the city,
which renders them very unsafe." In his history of
England, Smollet declares that "thieves and robbers
are now become more desperate and savage than
they had ever appeared since mankind was civilized."</p>

<p>No thoroughfare was free from the tyranny of
the fraternity of highwaymen, who were allowed to
terrorize whole districts, and who enjoyed an almost
unlimited freedom from interference. As their
depredations grew more extensive, their insolence
increased. Evelyn describes how a gang of robbers
succeeded in appropriating the taxes that had been
collected in the northern counties, as the bags containing
the money were being escorted through
Hertfordshire, on their way to London: the highwaymen
first stopped and secured all travellers in
the immediate neighbourhood, placed them under
guard in a field, and after killing the horses of their
captives to prevent pursuit, attacked the escort, put
them to flight, and captured the treasure. The
authors of this outrage were never caught.</p>

<p>Troops were sometimes made use of in a half-hearted
sort of way to patrol the most infested
localities, but the simple remedy of maintaining a
properly paid and equipped police was never tried:
the only expedient that the wisdom of the age could
suggest was the offering of rewards to all and sundry
to encourage the apprehending of highwaymen. This
disastrous policy was inaugurated in 1692.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> "Whereas
the highways and roads," runs the preamble of the
statute in question, "within the Kingdom of England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>and Dominion of Wales have been of late times more
infested with thieves and robbers than formerly, for
want of due and sufficient encouragement given, and
means used, for the discovery of such offenders,"
provision is accordingly made, that in the event of
any person being killed in the act of taking a highwayman,
his executors shall have the reward, and a
free pardon is promised to accomplices and other
criminals who shall cause such offenders to be
brought to justice. The conditions under which
this pardon was granted were as follows: "If any
person or persons, being out of prison from and
after the said five-and-twentieth day of March, commit
any robbery and afterwards discover two or
more persons, who already hath or hereafter shall
commit any robbery, so as two or more of the persons
discovered shall be convicted of such robbery&mdash;any
such discoverer shall himself have, and be
entitled to, the gracious pardon of their Majesties."</p>

<p>The provisions of this Act were afterwards extended
to robberies in London,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and first and last
were responsible for an appalling sum of wickedness.
The bait of blood-money and the lack of a salaried
or professional class of detectives were answerable for
the appearance of amateur thief-takers; these men
were mostly ex-thieves, who had given up their old
vocation for the safer, more lucrative, but infinitely
baser role of fattening on the conviction of the innocent,
and on the execution of those whom they had
themselves corrupted. The best known and most
energetic member of this horde of vampires was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>notorious Jonathan Wild, who flourished at the beginning
of the eighteenth century, and whose <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus
operandi</i> is fully set forth for us by Henry Fielding
in his satirical history of "Jonathan Wild the Great."</p>

<p>This arch-ruffian had a most complete knowledge
of all the thieves in England, and at one time practically
monopolised in his own person the trades of
receiver of stolen property and trafficker in blood
money. He established warehouses all over the
country, and even bought himself a ship to export
what he could not dispose of at home. To those
thieves who submitted to his authority, and who
brought him the proceeds of their robberies, he
extended a protection that must have been dependent
to a certain degree on the connivance of
some person or persons in authority. Grandmaster
of espionage, and holding in his talons the threads
of all villainy, Wild could manufacture whatever
evidence he chose, could ruthlessly destroy any who
opposed him, and deliver up to justice those thieves
who were bold enough to take their spoils elsewhere
for disposal. When this supply of victims ran short,
or when it suited his purpose to shield the real culprit,
he was content to take the reward offered for
the conviction of the innocent. It is comforting to
know that his carcass, the foulest fruit the fatal tree
ever bore, eventually swung at Tyburn, at the same
spot where so many of his victims had preceded him.</p>

<p>The iniquitous system of paying blood-money for
the conviction of certain classes of offenders continued
for generations, but is now happily extinct.
At the present day rewards are not offered by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>Government except under very exceptional circumstances,
and then only in cases where the identity
of the criminal is clear, whilst rewards offered by
private persons are placed under restrictions that
prevent any revival of the abominable traffic that
continued even into the nineteenth century. As late
as 1816 George Vaughan, and others associated
with him, were convicted at the Middlesex Sessions
of conspiring to induce three brothers named
Hurley, and a lad named Wood, only thirteen
years of age, to commit a burglary at Hoxton,
and by having them convicted of the fact, to procure
for themselves the rewards given by Parliament
for the conviction of housebreakers.</p>

<p>One of the chief embarrassments, after the inefficiency
of the constabulary, which hampered the
action of the authorities, and made the suppression
of crime more difficult, was the popularity that the
more notorious thieves enjoyed amongst a large
section of the people; the sympathy, felt and
expressed, for highwaymen of the Claude Duval
type was widespread, and arose from a variety of
sentiments. The mass of the people, who never
suffered in their own pockets, were not altogether
averse to seeing the rich plundered occasionally,
especially as it was the policy of the robbers to be
free and open-handed with a part of their booty.
Another class of people who were well-disposed
towards the highwaymen, gave their sympathy as
a misdirected kind of protest against the severity
of the law; and the "gentlemen of the road," as
they were called, quick to perceive the advantage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>that this popularity, from whatever source arising,
gave them&mdash;sometimes, but not often&mdash;performed
quite gentlemanly actions, in order to enhance and
to advertise their reputation for good deeds.</p>

<p>The Abbé le Blanc, who spent some years in
England early in the eighteenth century, declared
that he frequently met Englishmen who were as
proud of the exploits of their highwaymen as they
were of the bravery of their soldiers, and in a letter
to de Buffon he writes: "It is usual, in travelling,
to put ten or a dozen guineas in a separate pocket,
as a tribute to the first that comes to demand
them," and adds that, "... about fifteen years ago,
these robbers, with a view to maintaining their
rights, fixed up papers at the doors of rich people
about London, expressly forbidding all persons, of
whatever quality or condition, from going out of
town without ten guineas and a watch about them,
under pain of death. In bad times, when there is
little or nothing to be got on the roads, these
fellows assemble in gangs, to raise contributions
even in London itself; and the watchmen seldom
trouble themselves to interfere with them in their
vocation."<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Without attaching too much importance
to the statements of this foreign critic, it must
be confessed that at no time in our history have
the arrangements for maintaining the peace sunk to
so low an ebb as when thief-takers like Jonathan
Wild were officially recognised and allowed to co-operate
with the constitutional police forces, and at
no time has the flood of lawlessness reached such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>height as when highwaymen and footpads dictated
their own terms to all who made bold to use the
King's Highway. Yet the Government took no
steps towards organizing an adequate defence, and
utterly failed to provide any counterpoise to the
criminal tendencies of the age; it was left to
private enterprise to carry out the duties, or some
of them, that Parliament neglected to perform. In
1696 a "Society for the reformation of manners in
the cities of London and Westminster" was formed,
and in 1702 was instrumental in securing the conviction
of 858 "Leud and Scandalous persons."
Two years later, the Governors of the London poor
issued a proclamation, promising the sum of twelve
pence to any person who should apprehend "any
rogue, vagabond, or sturdy beggar," and, having
brought him before a Justice of the Peace, cause
him to be committed to the workhouse.</p>

<p>The particular kind of lawlessness, however, that
chiefly exercised men's minds in the days of Queen
Anne was the work of young men of the town,
commonly known as "Mohocks," who established
a reign of terror in London, and whose excesses
the peace-officers were powerless to prevent. The
worst outbreak occurred in 1712, and the doings
of these young blackguards are minutely described
in a pamphlet published in that year.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> "The watch
in most of the out-parts of the town stand in awe
of them, because they always come in a body, and
are too strong for them, and when any watchman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>presumes to demand where they are going, they
generally misuse them. Last night they had a
general rendezvous and were bent on mischief;
their way is to meet people in the streets and
stop them, and begin to banter them, and if they
make any answer, they lay on them with sticks,
and toss them from one to another in a very rude
manner. They attacked the watch in Devereux
Court and Essex Street, made them scower: they
also slit two persons' noses, and cut a woman in
the arm with a penknife that she is lam'd. They
likewise rowled a woman in a tub down Snow Hill,
that was going to market, set other women on
their heads, misusing them in a barbarous manner."</p>

<p>In spite of the public indignation that such
brutalities aroused, the feeble and timid watchmen
were not superseded, nor was any inquiry instituted
to discover the reasons for their inability to cope
with these scandalous proceedings. It was thought
rather a good joke that watchmen should be
knocked down, and constables overturned, whilst
the fact that London was left in complete darkness
during the greater part of the night seems
to have occasioned but little concern. There is a
saying to the effect that a good lamp is a good
policeman; but the subjects of Queen Anne, as it
seems, expected the peace to be maintained without
the assistance of either the one or the other,&mdash;the
lamps were only lighted at six o'clock in the evening,
and those that had not gone out before were extinguished
at midnight, and when the moon was full
they were not lighted at all.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<p>The outrages committed by the Mohocks were so
serious and persistent that something had to be done
towards putting a stop to them, and so recourse was
had to the objectionable expedient of offering a
government reward for the conviction of the members
of the gang. On the 17th of March 1712, the
Queen issued a Royal Proclamation in the following
words&mdash;"Anne R. The Queen's Most Excellent
Majesty being watchful for the Public Good of her
loving Subjects, and taking notice of the great and
unusual Riots and Barbarities which have lately been
committed in the Night Time, in the open Streets,
in several parts of the Cities of London and Westminster,
and Parts adjacent, by numbers of Evil
dispos'd Persons, who have combined together to
disturb the Public Peace, and in an inhuman
manner, without any Provocation have Assaulted
and Wounded many of her Majesty's good Subjects,
and have had the Boldness to insult the Constables
and Watchmen, in the Execution of their
Office, to the great Terror of her Majesty's said
Subjects, and in Contempt and Defiance of the
Laws of this Realm, to the Dishonour of her
Majesty's Government, and the Displeasure of
Almighty God, &amp;c., &amp;c.... Her Majesty doth
hereby promise and declare, That Whosoever shall
before the First Day of May now next ensuing,
discover to any of Her Majesty's Justices of the
Peace, any Person who, since the First Day of
February, last past, hath, without any Provocation,
Wounded, Stabb'd, or Maim'd, or who shall before
the said First Day of May, without any Provocation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>Wound, Stab, or Maim, any of her Majesty's Subjects,
within the said Cities of London and Westminster,
and Parts Adjacent, so as such Offenders
be brought to Justice, shall have and receive the
Reward of One Hundred Pounds, &amp;c., &amp;c."</p>

<p>The continuance of disorders, which Rewards and
Royal Proclamations were unable to check, and the
prospect that the Jacobites would not tamely accept
the rule of the House of Hanover, combined to make
the question of peace-maintenance a very difficult
problem for Queen Anne's successor. It is not surprising,
therefore, that one of the first legislative
enactments of George the First had for its object the
suppressing of public tumults. The Act referred to
is commonly called "The Riot Act,"<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and became
law in 1715. This Statute introduced no new principle&mdash;similar
enactments, or at any rate measures
which had the same object in view, had been frequently
brought forward by Tudor sovereigns and by their
predecessors, but in 1715 the offence of rioting
(together with the penalties attaching thereto) was
more clearly defined than had formerly been the
case, and extended powers were conferred on a
single Justice of the Peace or other authorized officer,
acting alone, for "preventing tumults and riotous
assemblies, and for the more speedy and effectual
punishing the rioters."</p>

<p>After reciting that "the punishments provided by
the laws now in being are not adequate to such
heinous offences" the Statute enacts, that if any
persons to the number of twelve or more, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>unlawfully, riotously, and tumultuously assembled
together, to the disturbance of the public peace, at any
time after the last day of July 1715, and after being
commanded by any one or more Justice or Justices
of the Peace, or by the sheriff, etc., by proclamation
in the Kings name, to disperse themselves, shall
unlawfully continue together for the space of one
hour after such command, then such continuing
together to the number of twelve or more, shall
be adjudged felony without benefit of clergy, "and
the offenders therein shall suffer death as in the case
of felony without benefit of clergy."</p>

<p>The method of making the proclamation is as
follows:&mdash;The Justice of the Peace or other authorised
person "being among the said rioters, or as near
to them as he can safely come" shall command
silence, and after that shall openly and with loud
voice make proclamation in these words:&mdash;"Our
Sovereign Lord the King chargeth and commandeth
all persons, being assembled, immediately to disperse
themselves, and peaceably to depart to their habitations,
or to their lawful business, upon the pains
contained in the act made in the first year of King
George, for preventing tumults and riotous assemblies.
God save the King." To constitute a riot it is
essential that alarm should be caused amongst the
King's subjects, and if the four last words of the
proclamation are omitted the reading of the Riot
Act has no virtue. If after proclamation has been
made the rioters do not disperse within an hour, any
or all of them may be apprehended by force, and if
they make resistance, the persons killing or injuring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>them are indemnified and discharged of all liability
with respect to any death or lesser injury they may
happen to inflict.</p>

<p>The general tone of public opinion was constantly
being lowered by the degrading spectacles that were
everywhere displayed. Government itself set the
example of brutality and violence by countenancing
the procession to Tyburn, the use of the pillory, and
the setting up of whipping-posts in the public streets;
with the result that imitators sprung up in abundance
to practice the lessons so sedulously taught by
the authorities. The punishment of the pillory was
in itself sufficiently severe, but the method of its
infliction practically amounted to the official legalising
of Lynch Law, because the populace were permitted
to torture the sufferer almost to any extent;
stone-throwing was nominally forbidden, but the
prohibition was not enforced, and, if a victim died of
the ill-usage to which he was subjected, no one was
punished.</p>

<p>The police, who were feeble and timid when
danger threatened, and who could never be trusted
to quell the most insignificant riot, grew bold on
occasions, when, without risk to themselves, they
could pounce upon some weak or unpopular individual.
Although whipping could be legally
inflicted only by order of the magistrate, it was no
unusual occurrence for a constable to take a man to
the nearest whipping post, and there have him
thrashed without reference to any superior authority
whatever.</p>

<p>For the safeguarding of prisons, banks, and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>important places, military guards were often used to
reinforce the ordinary watchmen, and, when so
employed, the soldiers were accompanied by constables,
whose duty it was to question passers-by,
to hand suspicious characters over to the guard, and
to bring them before a Justice of the Peace on the
following morning. These duties, simple as they
were, seem to have been negligently performed by
the peace-officers, for complaints of neglect of duty
were frequent; when Brigadier Mackintosh and his
companions escaped from Newgate, they were lucky
enough to pass the guard without examination,
because the constable was absent from his post, and,
in his absence, the military sergeant in charge had
no authority to detain fugitives.</p>

<p>Further evidence, were any required, of the
unsatisfactory condition of the parochial constabulary
in London is abundant&mdash;not only was delinquency
on the increase, but internal squabbles were everywhere
rife amongst the local bodies intrusted with the
preservation of the peace. In 1727 the Vestry of
St George's, Hanover Square, for example, established
a force of thirty-two watchmen and four bedels for
that parish; several of the inhabitants, however, refused
to pay the Watch-rate, and set up an opposition
establishment which they called "The Inhabitant
Watch" consisting of some sixteen persons, who
repudiated the authority of the existing constables,
and, on one occasion, flatly refused to arrest certain
offenders even when required to do so by the High
Constable.</p>

<p>An ineffectual attempt to reform the police of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>London was made in 1736, in which year an Act
of Parliament<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> was passed, giving powers to the
Common Council of the City to raise a sum of
money sufficient for all police purposes, to appoint
as many peace officers as they thought proper, and
to issue new and improved orders for the guidance
of the nightly watch. By the same statute, Aldermen
were made responsible for their respective
wards, constables were empowered to arrest night-walkers,
malefactors, and other suspected persons,
and watchmen, in the absence of the Constable,
might perform the duties of that functionary.
Liability to watch and ward extended to all the
inhabitants of London who were not "rated and
assessed," by virtue of the Statute of Winchester.</p>

<p>At about the same time, the police administration
of the rural districts was the subject of legislation, it
being enacted<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> that any constable neglecting to
make Hue and Cry shall be fined five pounds, and
the liability of the hundred, in which a felony has
been committed, for the escape of the felon is again
insisted upon. By another Statute,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> passed four
years later, High Constables were ordered to levy
a County Rate in the provinces and to pay the
proceeds over to a treasurer appointed by Quarter
Sessions, to be applied by him to the general
police purposes of the County.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the Civil Power ought to be
prepared for any possible emergency, but before
1829 this was far from being the case, and we find
that when any exceptional conditions arose, tem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>porary
expedients had to be hurriedly devised to
meet the crisis, affairs being allowed to slip back
into their normal state of unpreparedness immediately
the pressure was relieved. Such was the nature of
the arrangements improvised during the rebellion
in favour of the Young Pretender in 1745, when
London prepared to defend itself against the enemy
that marched southwards from Perth as far as Derby,
almost without a check. The trained bands, who a
hundred years before had barred the advance of
Charles I. at Turnham Green, were called out, and,
for a period of five months, the City Militia superseded
the normal police establishments.</p>

<p>At this time the trained bands consisted of six
regiments, viz., The Yellow, The White, The Orange,
The Blue, The Red, and The Green. Their numbers
amounted to close on ten thousand men, who at the
crisis undertook to protect London, not only against
a possible attack of an enemy from without, but also
against the depredations of thieves and rioters within.
The different regiments were told off to come on
duty in rotation, for twenty-four hours at a time, and
were disposed for police purposes in the following
manner. Near the Mansion House was placed the
main guard, and here the Commanding Officer was
to be found during his tour of duty; other guards,
under subordinate officers, being stationed at various
points in the city.</p>

<p>During the day, only "home-sentinels," as they
were called, were posted, but after sunset both
"out-sentinels" and patrols were added; these
patrols, called "petty-rounds," periodically visited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>the neighbouring sentries; in the event of any
rioting or other disturbance taking place, they had
to return immediately, and inform the officer in
charge. He was then instructed to march out his
party to suppress it, at the same time notifying his
commanding officer of the extent of the disorder, in
order that the latter might send the necessary reinforcements,
not only from the Main Guard, but from
the other guards also, in sufficient numbers until
peace was restored. Moreover, a general supervision
was maintained by means of "grand rounds,"
which starting from the Main Guard patrolled the
whole circuit to see that sentries were alert, that
patrols were acquainted with their duties, that the
countersign was correctly given, and to conduct
prisoners to head-quarters for subsequent disposal
by the magistrates. At daybreak reveille was
sounded, and all out-sentinels relieved; but the
home-sentinels were continued at their posts
throughout the day.</p>

<p>The retreat of the invaders, and their final rout at
Culloden, rendered the further embodiment of the
citizen soldiers unnecessary, but during the period of
their employment they performed their police duties
with so much success, that robberies in the streets of
London were for the time almost entirely suppressed,
and the King's Peace was maintained in unexampled
tranquillity. It does not appear that the Militia abused
the power placed in their hands in any way, whilst
the superiority of their rule over that of the watchmen
was so pronounced, that there was some talk in
after years of permanently handing over the policing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>of London to the trained bands; but the national
distrust of a too powerful gendarmerie prevailed,
and the old régime was allowed to continue. If the
suggestion had come to anything, it would of course
have been necessary to modify their organization
which was of a strictly military character; but
when the proposal was rejected an excellent opportunity
was lost of obtaining the services of a really
efficient body of men, at an expense to the ratepayers
far below that of the existing watch, which
then cost about £23 per night for the City proper,
besides what was paid by banks and private individuals
for special services.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>BOW STREET POLICE AND MAGISTERIAL REFORM</small></h2>


<p>It was not until the middle of the century that
any intelligence was brought to bear on the
problem of police, or that any promise appeared of
a better state of things in that department of government.
For an awakened interest and the resulting
improvement we are mainly indebted to the famous
novelist, Henry Fielding, who spent the closing
years of his short life in a vigorous campaign against
the growing domination of society by the criminal
classes. Appointed to the Westminster bench at
the age of forty-three, he exhibited in his new
capacity an acquaintance with law and a knowledge
of human nature, that were but rarely found in the
ranks of the magistracy of the day: his charge to
the Grand Jury, delivered in 1749, reads more like
the deliberate composition of a justice of assize of
large experience than the work of a junior magistrate
just appointed to the office.</p>

<p>In the hope of rousing the civil power from its
somnolent state, Fielding published a treatise called
"An Enquiry into the Cause of the late Increase of
Robbers," in which he gave an interesting account
of the habits and customs of the people, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>observations on the poor law, and on the apprehension,
trial, and execution of felons. He
attributed the prevalence of crime principally to
the luxurious habits indulged in by the populace,
especially gambling and drunkenness. With gin at
a penny the quartern, and high play the absorbing
passion of all classes, it was small wonder that crime
was on the increase. In his attempts to improve
the police, Fielding was ably seconded by his half-brother
Sir John Fielding, who succeeded him as
magistrate at Bow Street, and there inaugurated some
valuable and far-reaching reforms.</p>

<p>By the employment of regularly-paid detectives
he did more to render the streets of London safe
than the whole body of watchmen, beadles and
constables, to the number of about two thousand,
had previously been able to effect, and soon afterwards
obtained permission to establish, by way of
experiment, a small police force organised on novel
lines. This force, called the Bow Street Foot
Patrol, was divided into eighteen parties, thirteen of
which (called Country parties) patrolled the principal
highways outside the metropolis, whilst the remaining
five (known as Town parties) watched the
streets of the central district. The remuneration of
the patrols was high in comparison with the wages
then customary, no patrolman receiving less than
two shillings and sixpence a night. The system
proved a great success, and a few years later its
sphere of usefulness was enlarged by the formation
of a horse patrol, which was posted for the protection
of travellers on one or other of the main roads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>leading into the country. Though consisting only
of eight men, who, however, were well mounted and
well armed, it afforded a better state of security to
the suburbs than they had previously enjoyed.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The success that attended Sir John Fielding's
innovations was prompt and abiding. Bow Street
quickly became pre-eminent as the only court where
justice was dispensed in a business-like manner, and
its officers, under the name of Bow Street Runners,
became famous for their skill and sagacity. Sir
John Fielding was blind, but his infirmity did not
prevent him from constantly attending to his magisterial
work. When seated in court he used to wear a
white silk bandage over his eyes, and the striking
figure of the tall blindfolded knight was a dramatic
picture long remembered at Bow Street. His knowledge
of everything that concerned the criminal
classes was remarkable. It was said of him that he
never failed to recognise an old offender, though the
only indication he had to go by was the sound of
the prisoner's voice. He was the author of several
pamphlets on police questions, the most important
being that published in 1755 under the title of "A
plan for preventing robberies within twenty miles
of London"; the details of which may be briefly
stated as follows:</p>

<p>He suggested that the landowners and occupiers
of high-class residential property near London should
combine to form societies for the apprehension of
burglars and other depredators. Each society was
to select a treasurer to collect an annual subscription
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>of two guineas a-piece from the members. When a
robbery was committed, the injured party was to
immediately despatch a mounted messenger to the
magistrate at Bow Street, warning on his way all
the turnpike keepers, advising them as to the
property stolen, and of any other particulars of
importance. The magistrate was then to be empowered
to draw on the funds of the society in the
hands of the treasurer, for any expenses that might
be incurred in the course of the pursuit and subsequent
prosecution of the criminal.</p>

<p>This pamphlet was followed by a second called
"An account of the origin and effects of a Police,
set on foot in 1753 by the Duke of Newcastle, on
a plan suggested by the late Henry Fielding."<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The publications of the brothers Fielding were
to some extent instrumental in directing the public
conscience towards a consideration of the state of
the criminal law, which, year by year, had tended to
increase in severity, without thereby effecting any
diminution in the tale of offenders. "Extreme
justice is an extreme injury," wrote Sir Thomas
More, but abstract ideas of justice were little entertained
in the days of the Georges; Tyburn and
transportation were the only recognised remedies for
the more serious breaches of the law, and men were
slow to realise that it is better to make the commission
of crime difficult than to punish it with
indiscriminate severity. But from this time onwards
arose a genuine wish for some change, a desire to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>repress crime as humanely as possible; a half-formed
idea found partial expression that perhaps, after all,
the pain suffered by the culprit ought not to exceed
the benefit conferred on the community by the
punishment exacted; henceforward the Statute Book
was not disgraced by fresh barbarities, and in course
of years the old ones were gradually eliminated. In
1783 the procession to Tyburn was discontinued,
and the use of the drop to accelerate death by hanging,
introduced; the pillory was abolished in 1816
for all offences except perjury; whipping in public
was done away with the following year, and transportation
finally ceased in 1867.</p>

<p>Instead of legislating on the lines suggested by
Fielding, whose scheme of police was proving practical
and successful, the government preferred to
revert to the methods of Queen Elizabeth,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and in
1755 was responsible for an Act<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> that was nothing
but an attempt to revivify the Westminster Statute
of 1584, the only new feature being the appointment
of a committee called "The Jury of Annoyances," a
body designed to see that the pavements were kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>in repair, and to prevent obstructions and encroachments
thereon; this addition, it was supposed,
brought the Act up to modern requirements. The
number of constables to be yearly appointed for the
City and Liberty of Westminster was fixed at eighty,
furnished proportionally by the different parishes;
any man who had already served, personally or by
deputy, was not to be again chosen until seven years
had elapsed since he last held office.</p>

<p>Two years later another Act,<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> to explain and
amend the foregoing, followed, by which a regular
chain of responsibility was created; the petty constable
had to obey the High Constable; and he,
again, had to observe the lawful commands of the
Dean or High Steward, who still remained the
paramount police authority in the district.</p>

<p>In 1772, the House of Commons appointed a
Committee to inquire into the burglaries that had
recently become so frequent in London and Westminster,
one hundred and four houses having been
broken into between Michaelmas 1769 and March
1770. This committee was the first of a long series
authorised by Parliament with the idea of improving
the police; every few years a new committee was
appointed, and each in turn recorded a wearisome
tale of resolutions without finding a remedy or indeed
arriving at any satisfactory solution. One and all
reported that the existing watch was deficient, a fact
long patent to everybody without the assistance of
select committee-men; they deplored the want of
uniformity and co-operation in wards and parishes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>and recorded the shortcomings of beadles, constables,
and watchmen; but whilst suggesting various minor
reforms, they failed to see that no real progress was
possible until a clean sweep had been made of the
old system and its abuses.</p>

<p>The principal witnesses examined before this first
committee were Sir John Fielding of Bow Street
and Mr F. Rainsforth, the High Constable of Westminster;
the former spoke as to the position of the
magistracy and the state of the liquor traffic; the
latter confined his remarks to the inefficiency of the
peace-officers. The following extracts from Mr
Rainsforth's diary for the 23rd of March 1770,
which he read to the committee, shew us the kind
of thing that used to go on.</p>

<p>"Saint Margaret's&mdash;Three quarters past eleven:
constable came after I was there: Houseman and
Beadle on duty: 41 watchmen, with St John's
United, at 8&frac12;d. per night, with one guinea at Christmas,
and one guinea at Lady Day, and great coats
as a present: their beats large: was obliged to
take a soldier into custody for being out of his
quarters, and very insolent, with several more soldiers
in the street at 12 o'clock: called out 'Watch,' but
could get no assistance from them.</p>

<p>"St Clements' Danes&mdash;Past 3: no constable on
duty: found a watchman there at a great distance
from his beat: from thence went to the night-cellar
facing Arundel Street in the Strand, which is in the
Duchy, and there found 4 of St Clements' watchmen
drinking. St Mary-le-Strand no attendance,
having only two constables, which only attend every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>other night, 3 watchmen, Duchy included, at one
shilling each. A very disorderly cellar near the new
church for selling saloop, etc., to very loose and suspected
persons: St Clements' watchmen 32 at one
shilling."</p>

<p>After hearing much evidence of this description,
the committee passed thirteen resolutions, none of
which, however, were of a very vigorous character.
They recommended an increase in the number of
watchmen, higher pay and a better method of
appointing them; they suggested that the name
"beadle" should no longer be used, that ballad-singers
should be suppressed, and that steps should
be taken to put a stop to the custom of granting
wine and spirit licences indiscriminately to all who
applied for them, adding by way of a conclusion
to the whole matter, that the Roundhouses, as the
constables' lockups were called, should not be used
for the sale of intoxicants, and should be large
enough to accommodate the prisoners arrested by
the watch; it having frequently been found necessary
to release disturbers of the peace and other
minor offenders to make room for more serious
cases!</p>

<p>In consequence of the report of the Parliamentary
Committee, a bill was introduced into the House of
Commons to provide an improved watch system for
the "City of Westminster and parts adjacent ...
uniformly ordered and regulated throughout the
whole district." This Act,<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> passed in 1773, directs
that trustees shall meet annually to appoint "what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>number of watchmen they shall judge necessary to
be kept and employed" for the ensuing year, specifying
how many are to be apportioned to "beats"
and "stands" respectively, and how many are to be
told off for patrols. The local authorities are not,
however, given a free hand in the administration of
the interior economy of their trust: the minimum
establishment that must be kept up by each parish
is fixed by law, and varies from sixty watchmen on
the beats and stands, and eight on patrol for St
George's Hanover Square, down to the single watchman
required for the "purlieus of the Savoy."
Watch-houses must be substantially built, and
watchmen are to be armed with staff and rattle,
provided at parish expense, as well as with lanterns
paid for out of their own pockets; the minimum
wage must not fall below one shilling and threepence
per night unless a man is employed by the
year, in which case his nightly remuneration need
not exceed one shilling: the hours are from 10 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>
until 5, 6, or 7 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> according to the season of the
year.</p>

<p>The duties of the watch comprise the apprehending
of disorderly and suspected persons and handing
them over to the constable; testing the fastenings of
houses, shops and warehouses, and warning the
occupier when necessary; twice every hour the
watchmen must patrol his beat, and "as loudly and
audibly as he can, proclaim the time of the night or
morning." On coming off duty, the watchman has
to submit his staff, rattle and lantern for the inspection
of the constable; neglect of duty entails a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>fine of ten shillings, and any person who assaults a
watchman in the execution of his office renders himself
liable to a £5 penalty; watchmen are forbidden
to frequent alehouses during their tour of duty, and
provision is made for the punishment of those
publicans who harbour them.</p>

<p>There is much that is good in this Act, but it
applied only to Westminster, and half of its provisions
were never carried out. Instead of the
uniform order that was to be established, the old
confusion continued, the fine of five pounds was insufficient
to protect the watchmen from assault, and
the peace officers still tippled in alehouses, whilst
thieves were comfortably carrying home the booty
they had so easily secured.</p>

<p>The utter inadequacy of the whole system of
defence against civil tumults, and the complete helplessness
of London to protect itself against mob
violence, was brought home to its inhabitants in a
startlingly convincing manner in the course of those
six terrible days during which their city was within
an ace of being destroyed at the hands of the rabble
let loose upon her streets by the crackbrained fanatic,
Lord George Gordon.</p>

<p>The events that took place in the first week of
June 1780, and which are to some extent familiar to
us through the pages of "Barnaby Rudge," would
never have happened if, in the earlier stages of the
outbreak, the rioters had had opposed to them even a
couple of hundred resolute constables, accustomed to
deal with mobs, and working under the direction of
officers experienced in the tactics of street-fighting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>At no time is an efficient civil force of such inestimable
value as it is at the first appearance of great popular
ferment; for in accordance with the strength or weakness
of the police at that moment, is the course of
after events decided. A crowd is like a great volume
of water, harmless as long as its embankments are
kept in repair and, if necessary, strengthened, but
capable of an infinite amount of mischief if once
allowed to break its barriers.</p>

<p>Anything like a full description of the Gordon
riots lies outside the scope of this book; but a brief
account of the principal features of the outbreak will
very properly find a place here, in order to illustrate
the degree of violence that an English mob is capable
of, when allowed to get out of hand, and for the
purpose of comparing these riots with others that
took place on subsequent occasions after our modern
police had been established. London is the mother-city
of the English-speaking races, all of which have
modelled their police forces on the metropolitan
pattern; and the Gordon riots, which were the most
violent ever experienced in this country, have therefore
served as a lesson to cities as distant from us
and from each other as Sydney and New York, forewarning
those responsible for the maintenance of the
peace in those places of the extent of the danger
that threatens when proper precautions are neglected.</p>

<p>The disturbances in question arose out of an
agitation directed against the Roman Catholics,
whose position had been much improved by a
recent Act of Parliament, the agitation culminating
in a demand for the repeal of the unpopular con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>cessions.
A monster petition was prepared, and it
was decided to present it to Parliament, with such
a display of force that a refusal would be unlikely.
Accordingly, at 10 o'clock on the morning of the 2nd
of June, as many as 60,000 people assembled in St
George's Fields to accompany Lord George Gordon
in his attempt to intimidate the legislature. Marching
to Westminster by different routes, the crowd closed
all the avenues to both Houses, stopped peers and
commoners on their way thither, and treated those
who fell into their hands with insult and personal
violence, smashing their carriages, tearing their clothes
and in some cases removing their wigs; many members
of Parliament were forced to put blue cockades
in their hats and shout "No Popery" before they
were released, others only regained their freedom on
promising to vote for the repeal of the obnoxious act.</p>

<p>Whilst these proceedings were taking place, a
squadron of horse arrived; but on being hooted
and threatened, the troopers declared that their
sympathies were altogether with the people, and
then trotted off amidst the cheers of the crowd,
who soon afterwards began to disperse, to riot in
other parts of the town. That evening the Roman
Catholic chapels attached to the Sardinian and
Bavarian embassies were looted and burned.</p>

<p>Rioting continued during the three days that
followed, the paralysed executive submitting in
helpless impotence, and it was not until the fifth
day that the climax was reached. The mob now
suddenly broke out into an almost inconceivable
state of fury, and overran the whole of London,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>pillaging and burning as they went, and spreading
terror in every direction: all business was suspended
and most of the houses were barricaded; many persons,
hoping to pacify the destroying furies, hung
blue flags out of their windows and chalked the
words "No Popery" on their shutters. An organized
attack was made on Newgate, and when the old
prison walls successfully withstood all the efforts of
the mob to injure them, the furniture from the
governor's house was thrown out of the windows
and piled up for a bonfire, with the idea of consuming
the great wooden gates; when these at
length gave way, the rabble poured into the gaol
through the smoking gateway, shortly to return
bringing with them three hundred liberated prisoners,
many of whom were under sentence of
death already, and over-ripe for any atrocity.
Matters now grew worse than ever, distilleries were
broken open, and the raw spirits poured down the
gutters to be lapped up by a crowd that was already
mad. An attempt to break into the Bank of England
was prevented by the guard stationed there, but many
houses, including Lord Mansfield's and Sir John Fielding's,
were burnt to the ground, and all books and
documents destroyed.</p>

<p>When thirty-six incendiary fires were raging
simultaneously, and when the King's Bench and Fleet
prisons had shared the fate of Newgate, the troops
and militia, who were employed with vigour only
at the eleventh hour, began to get the upper hand
of the rioters, and then only by dint of firing volleys
into the mass. Gradually through the next two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>days some semblance of order was restored, and by
the third morning the riots were at an end. The
official return handed in to the Secretary of State
showed that 210 people had been killed by the
troops and 248 wounded, several of whom subsequently
died; but the bill was not complete: the
public hangman claimed 21 more victims, and a
much larger number were transported for life. The
Lord Mayor of London was tried for his faulty
arrangements and for his alleged supineness, but
was let off with a fine of a thousand pounds. Lord
George Gordon's insanity saved him from the
consequences of his misdeeds.</p>

<p>These fatal riots should have taught the lesson
that soldiers are ill-suited to the task of putting
down civil tumult, and that their use entails an
unnecessary amount of bloodshed, especially when
their action is so long delayed that an increased
severity becomes necessary. Unfortunately the
lesson, if learnt, was not taken to heart: at any rate
no adequate remedy was proposed at the time. On
one point only was any light immediately thrown.
Hitherto some doubt had existed as to the legality
of employing the military to put down riots, but
on this occasion the King sought the advice of the
Attorney-General,<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> who gave it as his opinion, that,
as soldiers were also citizens, they could constitutionally
be used to prevent felony, even without the
Riot Act being read. It was well that this point
was cleared up, because circumstances will occasionally
arise when troops must be sent for as a last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>resource; but it is remarkable that, after the failure
of the soldier to keep the peace had just been
demonstrated in so signal a manner, no one should
have supplied the obvious rider, and suggested the
substitution of a more satisfactory agent. Half a
century slipped by before the necessary change
began in England; but on the principle of applying
the remedy to any limb except the diseased one,
Dublin was quickly provided with what London
lacked, and in 1786 was passed the "Dublin Police<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
Act,"<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> under which three Commissioners were appointed,
and given the command of a paid and
well-organised constabulary. In the course of the
following year the whole of Ireland came under the
protection of the new guardians of the peace, who,
developing as time went on, eventually reached that
state of efficiency that is now invariably associated
with the name of the Royal Irish Constabulary.</p>

<p>The magistrates of the period set the worst
possible example to their subordinate officers, and
there were but few of them who did not deserve
the name of "Trading Justices," that was so commonly
applied. Those who did not actually accept
bribes were usually ready to make a little extra
money by the improper and wholesale bailing, not
only of offenders who ought to have been kept in
confinement, but of innocent persons also, who ought
to have been immediately and unconditionally set at
liberty. The system was to issue warrants against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>helpless people for imaginary crimes, and then to
let them out on bail, the magistrate netting the sum
of two shillings and fourpence every time he repeated
the trick. James Townsend, a Bow Street
runner, who gave evidence on this subject before a
parliamentary commission in 1816, explained how
lucrative this practice used to be, "and taking up a
hundred girls, that would make at two shillings and
fourpence, £11, 13s. 4d. They sent none to gaol,
for the bailing them was so much better."</p>

<p>There is much to be said for the plan of employing
country gentlemen to administer justice, without
stipend, in the neighbourhood of their own estates;
but in London, where all the criminal talent of the
three kingdoms was collected, and where the duties
of magistrates became both difficult and onerous in
consequence, only inferior men could be induced to
undertake the office, and then only for the sake of
the patronage they could control, and for the perquisites
they were able to pick up. They were
distinguished neither for social position, nor for legal
knowledge, and readily succumbed to every temptation
that offered. As long as the magistracy was
corrupt, Acts of Parliament were powerless to purify
the police: the duty of the Government was plain if
not easy; the Commission of the Peace for Middlesex
had to be immediately purged of the Trading
Justices, and a scheme had to be introduced under
which capable and upright men would be secured
to take their place: the hands of the new magistrates,
when appointed, had to be strengthened and sufficiently
enlarged to enable them to grapple with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>problem of keeping order in London, a city which
besides being the most populous in Europe, had the
reputation of being the most difficult to manage, its
inhabitants quickly resenting any action of the
executive that threatened to interfere, in the smallest
particular, with their liberties or their customs. At
the same time it was necessary to devise a check
upon the magistrates, powerful enough to prevent a
recurrence of the old abuses.</p>

<p>The Middlesex Justices Bill, which was laid before
the House of Commons in March 1792, was an
attempt to satisfy the above-mentioned conditions,
and was framed on the model of the stipendiary
establishment already existing at Bow Street, where
satisfactory results had been obtained. It was
proposed to create five new police offices (shortly
afterwards increased to seven), and to appoint
three Justices to each, at a remuneration of £300
a year apiece. This salary was only to be paid on
the explicit understanding that they were neither
directly nor indirectly to apply to their own
benefit any of the fees received by them, from
whatever source arising, all such fees to be devoted
in future to reducing the expenses of the office.
The courts were to be open daily for the transaction
of business, one magistrate always to be in attendance,
empowered to dispose summarily of the cases
brought before him without the assistance of a jury.
Provision was also made for the appointment of six
constables to each office, at a wage not exceeding
twelve shillings a week, invested with authority to
apprehend any person suspected of malpractices who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>was unable to give a satisfactory account of himself.
Finally, the constables were to be under the control
of the magistrates, and the magistrates were to be
answerable to the Secretary of State, in whom was
to be vested the power of dismissal, as well as that
of appointment.</p>

<p>When introduced, the Bill was severely criticised,
Fox and Sheridan, who were two of its strongest
opponents, both declaring that the principle of a
magistrate punishing without the intervention of a
jury was barbarous and unconstitutional, and that
the proposal to set up constables with increased
powers was an unwarrantable attempt to oppress the
poor, already ground down under the heels of the
rich. It was advanced that the influence exerted
by the Ministry of the day over the magistracy was
already excessive, and that the real object of the
bill was to still further increase this influence, by
adding the power of conferring salaries to that of
making appointments.</p>

<p>The framers of the Bill, whilst denying the truth
of these statements, and confident of the ultimate
triumph of the principles they advocated, were
willing that the measure should at first become law
for a limited period only, and were content that
Parliament should have the opportunity of amending,
or even annulling its provisions, if on trial they
should prove unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>The Middlesex Justices Act first came into
operation, therefore, as an experiment. The seven
public offices were established in different parts of
the Metropolis at convenient distances from each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>other, the twenty-one Justices were appointed, and
the forty-two constables were sworn in, an insignificant
force indeed with which to contend against the
whole criminal array of London, but of great
historical interest as a development of the Bow
Street system, the two together forming the first
regularly organized and paid force ever established
in England. The acknowledgement of the desirability
of employing stipendiary magistrates in
crowded centres was no less important, and gradually
led up to the system that is found so valuable to-day,
not only at the metropolitan police courts, but also
in those great towns where the principle has, in
recent years, been adopted.</p>

<p>The reform of the magistracy that was taken in
hand in 1792 was not so thorough as it might have
been, and the opportunity that then offered of
removing once and for all every unworthy taint from
the administration of justice in the metropolis was
only partly taken advantage of.</p>

<p>The Middlesex Justices Bill was conceived in too
parsimonious a spirit, and the right sort of men did
not come forward to fill the important posts of police
justices, many of the new magistrates, in fact, being
recruited from the ranks of the old discredited class,
which it was one of the principal objects of the Bill
to displace. Neither the justices nor the constables
received a salary large enough to make them
independent of improper sources of income, the
latter being openly permitted to engage in various
lucrative transactions that had nothing to do with
their office. It is said that constables attached to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>the public offices would not infrequently fill the role
of counsel for the prisoner, as well as holding a brief
for the prosecution.</p>

<p>The small force called into being by the Act of
1792, and which, including the Bow Street officers,
amounted to about fifty men, was designed only
against individual criminals; the idea of preventing
or repressing riots by means of a civil police force was
hardly considered to fall within the range of practical
politics. At the moment when the success of the
revolutionary leaders had achieved the overthrow of
the French Monarchy, and had culminated in the
execution of Louis the Sixteenth, established
authority all the world over was in danger of
subversion. The violent utterances of certain
Radical Societies shewed that there were many in
England who violently sympathised with the
Revolution, and the riots that took place in many
of our towns proved that the excesses which had
turned the streets of Paris into shambles, were
finding an echo amongst the discontented and
disorderly on this side of the Channel.</p>

<p>Considering the urgency of the matter, the attitude
assumed by the Government then in office
seems altogether incomprehensible. The political
horizon was assuredly dark enough to warn the
most heedless; and the signal manner in which the
military had failed to keep order during the Gordon
Riots conclusively demonstrated how unreliable was
that arm for the purposes of peace maintenance.
Yet the only steps taken by the responsible authorities
were to embody the Militia, and to pass an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>ill-considered measure called "The Alien Act,"<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
which required that all foreigners resident in
England (unless duly naturalized), should provide
themselves with passports, or forthwith leave the
country.</p>

<p>That we survived the crisis without having to
face a similar conflagration was hardly due to the
foresight of our rulers, who, though well aware
that our preventive appliances were rusty and out-of-date,
neglected to replace them by others, or even
to modernize them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>PAROCHIAL POLICE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</small></h2>


<p>Before proceeding to a narration of the successive
steps that culminated in the radical
reorganization authorized in 1829, it is necessary
to describe the nature and extent of the various
police establishments as they existed at the close
of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Exclusive of Special Constables, who, though
legally available, were but rarely if ever employed,
there were, at this time, five distinct classes of Peace
Officers:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="peaceofficers">
<tr><td class="tdr">(i.)</td>
    <td class="tdl">Parochial Constables, elected annually in
Parish or Township and serving gratuitously.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">(ii.)</td>
    <td class="tdl">Their Substitutes or Deputies serving for a
wage voluntarily paid by the Principals.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">(iii.)</td>
    <td class="tdl">Salaried Bow Street Officers, and Patrols
expressly charged with the suppression of
highwaymen and footpads.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">(iv.)</td>
    <td class="tdl">Stipendiary Police Constables attached to
the Public Offices established under "The
Middlesex Justices Act."</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">(v.)</td>
    <td class="tdl">Stipendiary Water-Police attached to the
Thames Office, as established by Act of
Parliament in 1798.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<p>It will be noticed that of these five classes, numbers
i. and ii. were common to the whole of England,
whilst numbers iii. iv. and v. were peculiar to
London and its immediate neighbourhood, but, for
our present purpose, it will be more convenient to
consider the provincial constabulary as altogether
distinct from the various Metropolitan Police bodies.
Theoretically and constitutionally, there should
have been little or no difference between the
policing of London and that of any rural district,
but the stage of development reached in the
Metropolis already foreshadowed the impending
changes, whilst in the country the standard of
police had as yet deviated hardly at all from the
mediæval pattern.</p>

<p>Leaving the London police establishments, therefore,
for future consideration, we find that in rural
districts, and in provincial towns, High Constables
and Parish Constables, acting under the direction of
the Justices of the Peace, continued to exercise the
time-honoured powers which had been handed down
to them from forgotten generations. To get a clear
idea of how the old-time system adapted itself, more
or less, to the changed conditions that prevailed in
the nineteenth century, the best way is to turn to
what we may call the police text-books of the period
such as the "Treatise on the Functions and Duties
of the Constable," by Colquhoun (1803), or "The
Churchwardens' and Overseers' Guide," by Ashdowne,
published at about the same time. "The High
Constable," says Colquhoun, "has the superintendence
and direction of the petty constables, head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>boroughs,
and other peace officers in his hundred or
division. It is his duty to take cognisance of, and
to present, all offences within his hundred or division
which lead to the corruption of morals, breaches of
the Lord's Day, Drunkenness, Cursing and Swearing.
To bring forward sufficient number of constables
to maintain decency and good order during the
execution of malefactors or the punishment of
offenders, and to attend in person to see that the
peace officers do their duty. To summon petty
constables to keep order in the Courts of Justice
&amp;c...." With regard to tumults and riots,
"to do all in his power to arrest offenders, and so
to dispose of his constables as to suppress the
disorders in question, also to give assistance to
neighbouring divisions ... to present all persons
exposing for sale unwholesome meat ... and to
take cognisance of false or deficient weights and
measures." In another place he declares that petty
constables should regularly perambulate their districts
once at least in every twenty-four hours, and
visit all alehouses once a week "to see that no unlawful
games are permitted, and that labouring
people are not suffered to lounge and tipple until
they are intoxicated." The duty of petty constables
when riots are threatened is thus described. "The
instant a constable hears of any unlawful assembly,
mob, or concourse of people likely to produce
danger or mischief within or near his constablewick
or district (he must) give notice to the nearest
Justice, and repair instantly to the spot with his
long or short stave, and there put himself under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>direction of such magistrate or magistrates as may
be in attendance."</p>

<p>"The Churchwardens' and Overseers' Guide and
Director" is arranged in the form of a vocabulary,
and in alphabetical order gives explanations of the
principal matters with which Parish Officers are
chiefly concerned. "Constables," we learn, "are to
make a Hue and Cry after the offenders where a
robbery or felony is committed, to call upon the
parishioners to assist in the pursuit: and if the
criminal be not found in the liberty of the first constable,
he is to give notice to the next, and thus
continue the pursuit from town to town, and from
county to county; and where offenders are not
taken, constables are to levy the Tax to satisfy an
execution on recovery against a Hundred, and pay
the same to the Sheriff &amp;c...."</p>

<p>"Hundreds or Wapentakes," according to Ashdowne,
"are generally governed by a High Constable,
under whom a Tythingman or Borsholder is
generally appointed for each Borough or District
within the Hundred. Hundreds are liable to penalties
on exportation of wool, liable also for damages
sustained by violently pulling down buildings; by
killing cattle; cutting down trees, ... by destroying
turnpikes, or works on navigable rivers; by
cutting hopbines; by destroying corn to prevent
exportation; by wounding officers of the Customs;
by destroying woods &amp;c.... Hundreds are also
bound to raise Hue and Cry when any robbery is
committed within the Hundred; and if the offender
is not taken, an action may be maintained against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>the Hundred to recover damages."<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Under the
heading of "Swearing" is arranged the following
information:&mdash;"Persons guilty of profane swearing,
and convicted thereof, to forfeit to the Poor of
the Parish. Day-Labourers, common soldiers, or
common seamen, 1/-. Persons under the degree of
gentlemen, 2/-. Gentlemen or persons above the
degree of gentlemen, 5/-. The above penalties to
be doubled for a second offence, and trebled after a
second conviction."</p>

<p>Of Tythingmen the same author writes:&mdash;"There
is frequently a Tythingman in the same town with a
constable, who is, as it were, a deputy to exercise
the office in the constable's absence; but there are
some things which the constable has power to do
that tythingmen cannot intermeddle with. When
there happens to be no constable of a parish, the
office and authority of a Tythingman seems to be
the same under another name."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>If anyone should be inclined to doubt the remarkable
stability of the Constable's office, and all that
pertains to it, he may find it instructive to look back
a few hundred years, and refer to what Lambard
and others have to say about Tythingmen and
Constables, part of which is quoted in the third
chapter of this book.</p>

<p>To the scope and intention of the functions exercised
by parish officers as stated by Colquhoun and
Ashdowne, if somewhat old-fashioned, no exception
need be taken. The trouble was, however, that the
office-holders did not live up to the standard inculcated
by their teachers. The commonsense and
reasonableness of the whole system fell to the
ground whenever ignorant and unworthy agents
were entrusted with its administration, and such, unfortunately,
was the character of the large majority
of the police personnel. The parish constable was
incompetent, and the duties imposed on him were
either evaded, or performed in a purely perfunctory
manner. Under the circumstances such a tendency
was perhaps inevitable, for it is not to be
expected that unpaid services will be well performed
by the poorer classes without constant supervision.
Struggling men, who have to work hard to provide
for themselves, and for their families, are not
likely to overtax their energies in the service of
the State without reward, and those substitutes who
received a few shillings a year from their principals
were only careful not to exceed the minimum
amount of labour which could be exacted from them
compulsorily.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<p>Further consideration of the Rural Constabulary
must be postponed until we come to deal with the
reorganization which was set on foot in 1839. For
the present we must return to the Metropolis, where
the doomed parochial system was now tottering to
its fall, and where the need for reform was more
pressing than elsewhere. At the time we are considering,
London boasted a variety of police establishments,
all more or less disconnected. The City
had one organization, Westminster another, the public
offices distributed justice after a fashion in their
respective districts, and Bow Street prided itself
upon holding a position of complete isolation and
independence. Nor was this all&mdash;the whole of
the metropolis was split up into parishes, and each
parish made its own arrangements for keeping the
peace, or dispensed with police altogether, as it saw
fit. Twelve London parishes were thus entirely
unprotected: St James' and Marylebone employed
Chelsea pensioners, the City supported 765 watchmen,
Edgeware had no policeman and no patrol,
Camberwell armed its night watchmen with blunderbusses,
whilst St Pancras had no less than eighteen
distinct Watch Trusts, a source of weakness rather
than of strength, because they never co-operated
with each other. In Kensington the police force
consisted only of three headboroughs, excellent men
perhaps; but as Peel remarked, "if they had been
angels, it would have been utterly impossible for
them to fulfil the duties required from their situation."
Deptford, being without a single professional
watchman, was at one time patrolled by the inhabi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>tants,
who enrolled themselves into companies twenty
strong for that purpose, quickly disbanding, however,
as soon as the robbers moved into another district.
In some parishes, again, there were patrols and no
beats, and in others there were beats and stands
but no patrols, despite the recommendations of
Special Commissions and the provisions of Acts of
Parliament.</p>

<p>The degree of security extended to the ratepayers
by the local authorities was thus a very variable
quantity; but it is not too much to say that without
exception the constitution of all the parochial police
bodies was antiquated and radically unsound, and
that Watch and Ward was at this time more indifferently
kept than had previously been the case
throughout the whole history of the Metropolis.</p>

<p>In the year 1800 Parish Constables were generally
permanent deputies and of inferior origin; nor was
any trouble taken to secure officers of the right stamp.
The wages paid to Parish Watchmen were miserable,
and the men usually engaged were those whose
antecedents and qualifications precluded them from
obtaining more lucrative or reputable employment.
These "Charlies" (as they were popularly called,
after their predecessors the Bell-men, instituted in the
reign of Charles the Second) were for the most part
infirm from age and starvation, drunken, the creatures
of street-walkers and publicans rather than servants
of the public, and altogether contemptible. Dressed
in heavy capes, muffled up to the ears, provided with
long staves and dim lanterns, they issued from their
watchboxes twice an hour for a minute or two to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>call the time and the state of the weather. As
clocks and barometers they may have been of some
service; or, as somebody once put it, to wake a man
up after his house has been robbed to tell him the
bad news; but for the prevention of crime, they
were worse than useless. Striking their staves on
the pavement, and shewing their lanterns, they gave
timely warning of their approach; and if the thieves
thought it worth while to take any notice at all of
such a trivial interruption, they had only to remove
themselves temporarily into the next parish to be
secure from pursuit.</p>

<p>As an object for practical joking, and as a theme
for ridicule, the Charlies provided some amusement
to the Jerry Hawthorns and Corinthian Toms of the
period, but this was the extent of their usefulness.
Quite a considerable literature hinged on their
grotesque incompetency, but in their praise not a
syllable was uttered; everyone made fun of them.
They were humorously described as "persons hired
by the parish to sleep in the open air," and another
topical saying was to the effect that "Shiver and
Shake" ought to be substituted for "Watch and
Ward," because they spent half the night shivering
with cold and the other half shaking with fright. It
was a popular amusement amongst young men of
the town to imprison watchmen by upsetting their
watchboxes on top of them as they dozed within;
and the young blood who could exhibit to his
friends a collection of trophies such as lanterns,
staves, and rattles, was much accounted of in smart
society. The newspapers were never tired of skits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>at the expense of the parochial watch: the following
extract from <cite>The Morning Herald</cite> of October 30th,
1802, will serve as an example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is said that a man who presented himself for
the office of watchman to a parish at the West End
of the Town very much infected by depredators, was
lately turned away from the Vestry with this reprimand&mdash;I
am astonished at the impudence of such a
great sturdy strong fellow as you are, being so idle
as to apply for a watchman's situation, when you
are capable of labour." Another publication calling
itself "The Microcosm of London" gives its readers
a satirical account of the nightly watch in these
words. "The Watch is a Parochial establishment
supported by the Parochial rate, and subject to the
jurisdiction of the magistrates: it is necessary to the
peace and security of the metropolis, and is of considerable
utility: but that it might be rendered much
more useful cannot be denied. That the Watch
should consist of able-bodied men, is, we presume,
essential to the complete design of its institution, as
it forms a part of its legal description: but that the
watchmen are persons of this character, experience
will not vouch: and why they are chosen from
among the aged and incapable must be answered
by those who make the choice. In the early part
of the last century, an halbert was their weapon: it
was then changed to a long staff: but the great coat
and lantern are now accompanied with more advantageous
implements of duty&mdash;a bludgeon and a
rattle. It is almost superfluous to add, that the
watchhouse is a place where the appointed watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>men
assemble to be accoutred for their nocturnal
rounds, under the direction of a constable, whose
duty being taken by rotation, enjoys the title of
Constable of the Night. It is also the receptacle for
such unfortunate persons as are apprehended by the
watch, and where they remain in custody till they
can be conducted to the tribunal of the police office,
for the examination of a magistrate."</p></div>

<p>The watchhouses here referred to were dirty and
insecure hovels, with an underground cellar secured
by a grating, behind which prisoners were confined,
sometimes for forty-eight hours, but in the case of
minor offences a tip of half-a-crown to the constable
was generally sufficient to secure release.</p>

<p>In 1804 there were 2044 parochial constables
and watchmen in the Metropolis, including the 765
employed by the City, that is to say, about one
watchman to every seventy or eighty houses.</p>

<p>The City of London was much better policed than
the rest of the Metropolis. It was said that so
superior were the arrangements eastward of Temple
Bar to those of the more westerly districts, that a
pickpocket was easily recognised when he came to
the City boundary, because he always walked so fast,
and so often looked over his shoulder, as if he
suspected that someone was after him. The watchmen
appointed by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen
were selected from a better class of men than were
those who held office in Westminster and other
parishes; they were also better paid and more carefully
superintended. In 1815 the Lord Mayor
himself, on more than one occasion, visited the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>watch by night and had the men mustered, discharging
on the spot those whom he considered
unfit. Briefly the organisation was as follows&mdash;the
City was divided into four divisions with three day
patrols to each division, in all twelve patrolmen at
one and a half guineas a week each. By night,
whilst the constables and watchmen were on duty,
the patrols were reduced to eight, two to a division;
their duties were, to visit the watchhouses at least
twice a night, to see that the constable of the night
was not absent from his post, signing their names at
every visit in a book kept for the purpose at the
several watchhouses. The Constables of the Night
were paid no salary, but were generally in receipt of
fees from the elected householders whose deputies
they were. They were bound to be present with
the watch all night long, and were held responsible
that the watchmen did their duty. In time of riot,
or when disturbances were apprehended, the Lord
Mayor had power to summon them, together with
the watch, at any hour&mdash;by day as well as by night,
for the maintenance of the peace. The task of supervising
the City police was entrusted, not to a High
Constable, but to the two City Marshals, whose duty
it was to pay surprise visits to the watchhouses at
uncertain hours, to certify that the patrolmen's books
were duly signed up, and to report every morning to
the Lord Mayor concerning the "internal quiet of
the City of London." They also bound themselves
on oath to proceed against no man through malice,
and to screen no man through favour or affection.</p>

<p>Both in the city and in other parts of London,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>the management of the traffic was in the hands of
special officials called Street-keepers; but beyond
the regulation of vehicular traffic within the limits of
the parishes where they were employed, they had
no general police duties to perform, and were not
under the control of the magistrates, nor subject to
the police authorities.</p>

<p>The Burgesses of Westminster still suffered their
police administration to be bound by the ecclesiastical
traditions of bygone centuries; and if we make an
exception in favour of the "Jury of Annoyances,"
established in 1755, we may say that little evidence
of progress was discoverable within the Liberties of
the Western City. The Act creating the Annoyance
Jury was passed in the twenty-ninth year
of George II., and two years later was amended
and enlarged. The Court of Burgesses was now
empowered to maintain forty-eight inhabitants of
Westminster for the suppression of public nuisances:
members of this jury had authority to enter any
shop or house, and if they found any unlawful or
defective weight or measure therein, to destroy the
same, and to amerce the offender a sum not exceeding
forty shillings for each offence. In 1764 the
Jury was divided into three divisions, called St
Margaret's Division, the St James' Division, and the
St Martin's Division, each containing sixteen members;
at the same time it was ordained, that all
presentments had to be in writing under the hands
and seals of at least twelve jurymen. In 1800 the
Annoyance Jury was still nominally responsible for
the cleanliness, sightliness, and sanitary condition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>Westminster, but, as a matter of experience, the
removal and prevention of nuisances was left almost
entirely to the discretion and taste of the more
fastidious householders.</p>

<p>As has already been said, the Middlesex Justices
Act was at first an experimental measure; in 1801
it was repealed, but most of its provisions were at
once re-enacted by a statute<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> which placed the
public offices on a more permanent basis, and raised
the salary of the magistrates and the wages of the
police officers. There were now ten of these offices,
viz., Mansion House, Guildhall, Hatton Garden,
Worship Street, Whitechapel, Shadwell, Southwark,
Queen Street Westminster; Great Marlborough
Street, and Wapping. Mansion House and Guildhall
belonged to the City proper, and Wapping was the
headquarters of the River Police. To each office
were apportioned three magistrates, eight constables,
and a clerk or two. The magistrates sat in rotation,
and, within the limited areas of their respective
jurisdictions, acted independently of their colleagues.
There was little uniformity or co-operation. Each
office had a general duty of apprehending and
punishing any criminals found within its boundaries,
but had no connection with the Nightly Watch.
The different parishes concerned had transferred to
the public offices the duties connected with Hue and
Cry, whilst retaining in their own hands the responsibilities
of Watch and Ward. The relations existing
between the parochial and stipendiary authorities
were not cordial, in fact there was frequently a pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>nounced
enmity between the parish constable and
the police constable, whilst the amateur peace officer
not infrequently set at defiance the professional
magistrate. The impossibility of controlling the
local watchmen conduced to a very unsatisfactory
state of affairs, as is seen by the following evidence
given before the 1816 Committee by Mr Robert
Raynsford, the magistrate of Hatton Garden. "At
present, as the law now stands," he said, "we have
no power at all over the parish watchmen: but when
this question was agitated on a former occasion, the
parishes had so rooted an aversion to the interference
of the magistracy, that I believe there were petitions
from most of the parishes: at the same time there
are offences committed in the streets, close by a
watch-box, and we are told that the watchman was
fast asleep, or would give no assistance: we have
no power of sending for the watchman, or if we
did, we have no power of punishing him. I think it
would be an improvement if they were put under the
direction of the Police."</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Middlesex Justices
Act had placed the police offices under the control
of the Home Office, which had the power of appointing
and dismissing the magistrates: this was right
and proper, but it would have been far better if any
further supervision exercised by the Secretary of
State had been confined to the larger and more
general issues connected with the police establishments,
and had stopped short of the injudicious
meddling that went on. The magistrates might
surely have been trusted with the selection of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>own constables, but, for some occult reason, successive
ministers seem to have thought it their duty to
diminish the authority of the magistrates by actively
interfering with the nomination and election of the
rank and file. Under these circumstances it is
strange that the magistrates were as well served by
their subordinate officers as they seem to have been,
yet, everything considered, the stipendiary policeman
proved so superior to the amateur constable that
Maurice Swabey, the magistrate at Union Street,
declared, that he would rather have six additional
officers than fifty parish constables.</p>

<p>From the list of the Public Offices above enumerated,
the most interesting has intentionally been
omitted, because its unique position calls for separate
and more detailed notice. Besides being of earlier
date than the other offices, Bow Street exceeded
them also in importance, and was distinguished as
the centre of the police activities of the time. From
Henry Fielding, who presided in 1753, to Sir
Franklin Lushington, who recently succeeded Sir
John Bridge, the Chief Magistrate at Bow Street
has nearly always been a man of mark amongst his
brother stipendiaries, and in their day the Bow
Street Runners (as the officers attached to this Court
used to be called) were of quite a different type from
their comrades employed in the junior offices.</p>

<p>Though only eight in number (afterwards increased
to twelve) these runners exerted a preponderating
influence, which largely altered the aspect of the
contest between the professional thieves and the
helpless public on whom they preyed. The Bow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>Street policemen were the first peace officers to
make a serious study of the art of detecting and
running down criminals: they were experts whereas
all their predecessors had been amateurs; no longer
dull officials performing routine duties in perfunctory
fashion when "not otherwise engaged"; but keen
hunters with all their faculties stimulated by the
prospect of the blood money and other rewards they
hoped to earn. When they appeared on the scene
the professional depredator no longer had things all
his own way; instead of the parish constable who
could be outwitted and bamboozled at every turn,
the cracksman or forger found himself confronted by
a wary adversary, well armed, and up to every move
on the board. That the Bow Street Runners achieved
much good in breaking up predatory gangs, and in
bringing notorious offenders to trial, is not to be
denied, but it is no less certain that they were the
source of much evil. Actuated by the hope of gain
rather than by any sense of duty, their motives were
as ignoble as their methods were shady. They
played only for their own hand, and all their best
endeavours were bent towards the arrest of the
particular criminal whose conviction would bring
the greatest profit to themselves, and not to the
pursuit of the fugitive from justice whose capture
was chiefly desirable on public grounds. Prevention
did not enter at all into their conception of police
duty, and their services were of course only at the
disposal of those who were rich enough to pay
handsomely for the privilege. The extent to which
this system of feeing was carried may be guessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>from the fact that Townsend left £20,000 behind
him, and that Sayer's heirs divided no less than
£30,000 at the death of their benefactor.</p>

<p>In order to obtain information, the runners made
it a rule to frequent low "flash-houses," as the resorts
of thieves were called, and to associate with the
vicious and desperate characters to be found there.
When examined before a Parliamentary Commission,
several of these officers freely admitted that it was
by the employment of such tactics that they expected
to obtain the most valuable information, and gave
it as their opinion that flash-houses ought to be
encouraged rather than suppressed, on account of
the facilities they afforded the runner in his search
for a man who was "wanted."</p>

<p>There were, no doubt, many honest men amongst
the Bow Street Officers doing their duty to the best
of their ability after their lights, and although their
methods would not be tolerated for a moment at the
present day, they were much in advance of their predecessors.
Certain of them attained a wide celebrity.
Such men as Lavender, Nelson and others&mdash;unique
characters in their way&mdash;made it their business to go
everywhere and know everybody: they carried a
small baton surmounted by a gilt crown, and this
badge of office admitted them not only to such unsavoury
dens as "The Dog and Duck" and "The
Temple of Flora," but even into the Royal Palaces,
where two officers, we learn, were constantly stationed
"on account of the King being frequently teased of
lunatics." Runners were often specialists, occupying
themselves in one line of business to the neglect of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>others: thus, whilst that well-known gossip Townsend
chiefly confined himself to safeguarding the property
of his wealthy clients, and to capturing noble duellists,
Keys devoted himself to circumventing coiners and
forgers of bank notes, and a third was principally
engaged in the detection and apprehension of
"Resurrectionists."</p>

<p>There is no doubt that more than one of the Bow
Street policemen were actually in league with the
depredators they were paid to catch, though they
were generally too alert to be found out; but the
confidence of the public in their thief-takers received
a rude shock when Vaughan, of the Horse Patrol,
was proved to have arranged a burglary for the sake
of the reward that would have come to him on the
conviction of the felons. "Set a thief to catch a
thief" may sometimes be good policy, but it is
nearly always bad police.</p>

<p>The Patrols, Horse and Foot, which were attached
to the Bow Street Office, had been in existence some
fifty years or so, but had only consisted of a handful
of men quite insufficient for the amount of work that
was expected of them. In 1805 Sir Richard Ford,
the Chief Magistrate, obtained permission to extend
the system of mounted police so as to provide patrols
for all the main roads to a distance of about twenty
miles from Bow Street. The strength of this new
force was fifty-two patrols, two inspectors, and a
clerk: they were recruited almost exclusively from
retired cavalrymen, and were familiarly known as
Robin Redbreasts on account of the red waistcoat
that was a conspicuous part of their uniform. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>were better paid than their predecessors, the wages
of a "patrol" being twenty-eight shillings a week,
with allowance for horse keep, and the salary of a
"conductor" standing at £100 a-year and a guinea
a-week for forage and shoeing. Their energies were
principally directed against highwaymen, and they
quickly cleared Hounslow Heath and other infested
localities from this class of plunderer. The Horse
Patrol cost the Government £8000 a year, not a
high price to pay for the suppression of those impudent
robbers "the gentlemen of the road." The foot
patrol policed the inner circle within a radius of
about four miles.</p>

<p>The legal powers of Bow Street were never very
strictly defined, but it was generally understood that
the jurisdiction of the Office was confined to the
County of Middlesex (the City of London excepted),
and to the main roads in the neighbourhood of
the metropolis which were patrolled by Bow Street
Officers. Under the direction of the Home Secretary,
the Chief Magistrate had, in fact, the control of a
small and independent force applicable to the general
police requirements of the capital and its environment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>POLICE AT THE DAWN OF THE NINETEENTH
CENTURY</small></h2>


<p>In the year 1801, the population of London and
Middlesex hardly exceeded a million, but how
many of the individual units that went to make up
this total were engaged in criminal pursuits, it is of
course impossible to estimate with any degree of
accuracy, because the bulk of the crime was undetected
and consequently unrecorded. From such
data as we possess, however, it is certain that the
proportion of thieves and other delinquents to honest
men must have been alarmingly high. Between 1801
and 1811 the population increased some sixteen per
cent., and during the same period the number of
commitments rose nearly fifty per cent.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> This increase
in the number of rogues whose careers were
cut short by capture, speaks well for the Bow Street
Runners from one point of view; but it also indicates
no less surely that these officers were making no
progress at all in the art of preventing crime, which
instead of diminishing as time went on, continued to
grow in volume year by year. Indeed the state of
the metropolis was such, that social reformers might
well have despaired of ever seeing an improvement;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>every corrupting influence, and every criminal tendency
seemed to flourish unchecked and unrebuked in
the congenial atmosphere of the London slums:
children, neglected by their parents and uncared for
by the State, got their only schooling in the gutter,
where they educated themselves, and each other, in all
the tricks of vice and dishonesty. Night after night,
undisturbed by watchmen or other peace-officers,
hundreds of urchins of both sexes huddled together
for shelter and company under the fruit-stalls and
barrows of Covent Garden Market. Day after day,
these homeless and unhealthy vagabonds quartered
the town, street by street, and alley by alley, in
search of any prey that they might be able to lay
their hands on. Their pickings and stealings were
turned into money with fatal ease at the shop of any
one of the eight thousand receivers of stolen property,
who were supposed to ply their trade in London;
and however meagre might be the income realised
by the juvenile criminal, drink in plenty, with gin at
tenpence a pint, was within the reach of all. Such
licensing laws as existed, were seldom enforced, and
even after the scandalous public lotteries had been
suppressed, public-houses continued to hold minor
lotteries, called "little-goes," for all comers, men,
women and children.</p>

<p>Mondays and Fridays were the great days for
bullock-hunting, an inhuman and brutal sport that
throve in the neighbourhoods of Hackney and
Bethnal Green, with the sanction, if not with the
connivance, of the peace officers of those parishes.
The procedure of the bullock-hunters was as follows.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>A fee having been paid to a cattle drover, an animal
was selected from his herd, peas were put into its
ears, sticks pointed with iron were driven into its
body, and the poor beast, when mad with rage and
pain, was hunted through the streets with a yelling
mob of men, women, and dogs behind it; the weavers
left their looms to join in the pursuit, and passers-by
continually augmented the crowd, until the exhausted
victim could no longer be goaded into any shew of
resistance or movement, when it was left to die where
it fell, or when sufficiently recovered, to be removed
to some butcher's slaughter-house.</p>

<p>On Sundays the favourite resort was a field adjoining
Bethnal Green Church, and here some hundreds
of men and boys assembled during the hours of
divine service, to indulge in less exciting games, such
as dog-fighting and duck-hunting. On holidays and
fair-days these Saturnalian proceedings grew more
outrageous than ever. In a letter descriptive of the
occurrences that used to take place at an annual fair
held in the West-end of London, which the Receiver
of the Metropolitan Police wrote to Lord Rosslyn in
1831, occurs the following passage: "It will hardly
be credited that within five or seven years ...
people were robbed in open day ... and women,
stripped of their clothes, were tied to gates by
the roadside; the existing police being set at
defiance."</p>

<p>John Sayer, the Bow Street officer, stated before
a Parliamentary Committee, that there were streets
in Westminster, especially Duck Lane, Gravel Lane,
and Cock Lane, infested by a gang of desperate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>men, and so dangerous that no policeman dared
venture there, unless accompanied by five or six of
his comrades, for fear of being cut to pieces. These
are not highly coloured fairy-tales, but actual facts as
recounted in the Blue-books of the period, recounted
moreover without exciting any particular notice at
the time. In 1812, the crime of murder was so
common, and so much on the increase, that a Parliamentary
Committee was appointed to hold an inquiry
as to the best means of combating the savage tendencies
of the people. Offences against property
were even more prevalent than crimes of violence.
Spurious coin and counterfeit banknotes deluged the
country.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> In the parish of Kensington alone there
were sixteen successful, and three unsuccessful, attempts
at burglary in six weeks, and John Vickery,
an experienced Bow Street officer, calculated that in
one month property to the value of £15,000 was
stolen in the City of London, without one of the
guilty parties being either known or apprehended.</p>

<p>Thieves and receivers, drivers of hackney coaches,
and sometimes toll-gate keepers, conspired together
to rob the travelling public. Their favourite <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus
operandi</i> was as follows&mdash;the thief climbed on the
back of the conveyance, unfastened the ropes that
secured the luggage, and with the assistance of an
accomplice, removed the trunk or other booty when
close to the house of the confederate receiver. As
soon as the loss was discovered, the coachman
repudiated all knowledge of the affair, and having at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>the first opportunity put away the false and resumed
his registered number, became to all appearance an
honest cabman, against whom the police could prove
nothing. The transformation was not difficult,
because numbers were not then painted on the
coach as on hackney carriages they now have
to be, but were displayed on a removable iron
label.</p>

<p>Still more serious were the conspiracies in which
solicitors and police officers were concerned, which
had for their object the levying of blackmail from
bankers and others. In this organized system of
fraud the following method was usually adopted&mdash;a
man of education, with money behind him, would
plan a bank robbery, purchase the necessary information,
and hire expert thieves to do the actual work.
The robbery having been duly effected, some time
would be allowed to elapse, and then the prime
mover in the affair, through his agent the police
officer, would notify to the manager of the bank that
the stolen notes or securities had been traced, and
might be recovered, if a large enough reward was
forthcoming. This offer was invariably coupled with
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proviso</i> that, in the event of the proposed restitution
being carried out, no further questions should
be asked, nor further proceedings taken.</p>

<p>The trick seldom failed, because the parties who
had been robbed knew, that in the absence of any
detective police agency worthy of the name, acceptance
of the terms offered them was the only chance
they had of recovering their property. Under the
circumstances, they could hardly be expected to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>public-spirited enough to incur the heavier loss, and
at the same time, through advertising the affair,
suffer some diminution of credit, for the sake of the
principles involved.</p>

<p>The Committee which sat in 1828, and which
investigated the whole question, considered it advisable
not to publish the evidence brought before
them, but stated that they had abundant proof that
frauds of this description had for years been carried
through with almost uniform success, and to an
extent altogether unsuspected by the public. They
were satisfied "that more than sixteen banks had
been forced to pay blackmail, and that more than
£200,000 worth of property had, in a short space of
time, been the subject of negotiation or compromise,"
and stated that about £1200 had been paid to blackmailers
by bankers alone, "accompanied by a clearance
from every risk, and perfect impunity for their
crimes."</p>

<p>Between 1805 and 1818 there were more than two
hundred executions for forgery alone, that is to say
at the rate of one execution in every three weeks.
When one considers that only a few of the forgers
were caught, that of these not all were convicted,
and that of the convicted but a moderate percentage
were hanged, we get some idea of the prevalence of
this particular offence. The alarming frequency
with which mobs began to appeal to violence to
compel attention to their grievances, real or supposed,
by force of arms, was one of the most
dangerous symptoms of the age. The Food Riots
of 1800, the Luddite disturbances of 1811-1816,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>Spafield (1816), Manchester (1817), Peterloo (1819),<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
and the riots throughout the manufacturing districts
in 1828-9, were all cases in point which convinced
the thoughtful that, unless something better than
the shoddy defence, which was all that the civil
power could then muster, was quickly forthcoming,
the mob would soon obtain a complete mastery, to
the destruction of all law and order, just as had
recently happened in France.</p>

<p>The mania for duelling, again, which was now at
its height, was an indication that the prevailing
spirit of lawlessness was not confined to the masses.
When hereditary lawgivers, and even Cabinet ministers,
could find no better way of settling their
differences than by calling each other out, little
wonder that the rank and file followed suit, and
took the law into their own hands. It is no valid
argument to say that duelling was merely a passing
fashion; by the Law of England any duel is a gross
breach of the peace; and that such deliberate infractions
should have become fashionable only proves
that the law was held in contempt, and that the
police system which failed to compel people to keep
the peace was totally inadequate to the requirements
of the times. There was a period when the
vendetta was the natural defence adopted by semi-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>civilised
communities to diminish the frequency of
murder, and to protect the honour of their women:
in time blood feuds gradually died out, not because
any great change had overtaken human nature, but
because there was no longer any need for the individual
or the family to perform duties which could
be executed with greater discrimination, impartiality,
and thoroughness by judges and policemen. After
the disappearance of the vendetta the custom of
duelling remained. It was felt that personal honour
was too delicate a matter to be delegated to any
outsiders, and that questions in which honour was
concerned must continue to be settled by the principals
themselves. Eventually however, the same
influences that rendered blood feuds unnecessary
removed the excuse for the practice of duelling;
under modern conditions, a man can usually vindicate
his honour by an appeal to public opinion, or, in the
last resort, by an action for slander, without having
to submit his cause to the uncertain arbitrament of
the rapier or the pistol.</p>

<p>On the whole, there is no exaggeration in saying
that, at the dawn of the nineteenth century,
England was passing through an epoch of criminality
darker than any other in her annals; the
resurrectionist atrocities of Burke and Hare, the
more inhuman villanies of Williams and Bishop
the cold-blooded depravity of Vaughan and his
accomplices, and the other lurid crimes which belong
to this age, surpass in enormity anything before or
since.</p>

<p>Such then was the desperate state of society at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>the dawn of the century. What arrangements did
the country make to protect itself against the consequences
of this accumulation of crime? What
organization was provided for the enforcement of
order, and for the protection of life and property?
For its first line of defence England trusted to the
supposed deterrent effect of a rigorous penal code;
the more humane and effectual method, prevention,
being lost sight of in the mistaken belief that it was
possible to extirpate crime by the severity with
which it was punished, a belief that survived in
face of the fact, that as punishment increased in
bitterness, so did offences grow in frequency and in
violence.</p>

<p>The penal laws were written in blood. Colquhoun
estimated that there were 160 different offences
which were punishable by death, without benefit
of clergy: a man could be hanged for larceny from
the person if the value of the article stolen was
more than one shilling: Townsend stated before
the parliamentary commission of 1816, that he had
known as many as forty people hanged in one
day: on another occasion seven persons, four men
and three women, were convicted at Kingston of
being concerned in robbing a pedlar, "they were
all hanged in Kent Street, opposite the door."
Such indiscriminate infliction of the extreme penalty
of the law could serve no useful purpose,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>contrary it undoubtedly aggravated the very offences
it was intended to check. The punishment for a
trivial theft being identical with that meted out for
the most heinous crime, all sense of proportion in
the different degrees of moral guilt was lost. "As
well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb" represented
a point of view not unnatural under the
circumstances, and expressed the actual mental attitude
of the average criminal.</p>

<p>It can easily be demonstrated that an inverse
ratio exists between the efficiency of police and the
severity of sentences.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The more difficult the commission
of crime is made, the less necessity will
there be for deterrent measures that savour of
vindictiveness. The intimate knowledge that an
effective police have of the habitual criminal class is
not only a safeguard against the conviction of the
innocent, but renders it possible to deal leniently
with the juvenile, and with the casual, offender.
Within reasonable limits, the fear of almost certain
detection is a far stronger deterrent than the distant
prospect of severe punishment. Sir Samuel Romilly
speaking in the House of Commons in 1810 said, "if
it were possible that punishment, as a consequence
of guilt, could be reduced to an absolute certainty,
a very slight penalty would be sufficient to prevent
almost every species of crime, except those which
arise from sudden gusts of ungovernable passion.
If the restoration of the property stolen, and only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>a few weeks, or even but a few days imprisonment,
were the unavoidable consequence of theft, no theft
would ever be committed. No man would steal
what he was sure he could not keep."</p>

<p>Romilly made strenuous efforts to persuade the
government to reduce the number of offences punishable
by death, but without immediate success. Sir
James Mackintosh followed in his footsteps, and
in 1822 proposed to the House that measures
should be adopted "for increasing the efficiency of
the Criminal Law by mitigating its vigour." It is
worthy of remark that, at this time, Peel opposed
the principles advocated by Mackintosh and Romilly,
though seven years afterwards he was the author of
the Act that gave effect to a part of Romilly's ideal,
"a vigilant and enlightened police, and punishments
proportioned to the offender's guilt."</p>

<p>The savage rigour of the penal code defeated its
own ends in many ways. People would not give
evidence that might condemn a man to such barbarous
treatment; juries would not always convict,
even when the evidence was perfectly clear.</p>

<p>Consequently the law often became a dead letter,
and the prospective criminal had many inducements
to tempt him to break it; for, in the first place, he
probably would never be caught; and in the second
place, the chances were, that the jury would evade
the responsibility of giving a verdict, that might lead
to a sentence, that would be an outrage to their
humanity.</p>

<p>With crime so increasingly prevalent, there might
have been some justification for great severity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>punishment, if it had been found by experience
that strong repressive measures had invariably been
followed by a permanent reduction in the number of
criminals; but this is not the lesson that history has
taught. It is true that exceptional cases have arisen
from time to time in which signal severity meted out
to a prominent offender has proved the safest and
best course. Prompt and exemplary punishment,
even in excess of his deserts, inflicted on a ringleader,
has often been the only way to enforce discipline or
to prevent the spread of dangerous mutiny; but
such cases are rare, and owe their success as
deterrents to their rarity, and to the attention
that they excite at the time; whereas a consistent
course of excessive severity has never been a lasting
success, unless combined with powerful preventive
measures,<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and then such a course is no longer
necessary. Highway robbery and sheep-stealing
were common when they were capital offences, now
they are seldom heard of, and the thieving that
invariably went on at the foot of the gallows was
sufficient proof that the popular belief in the deterrent
value of public executions was a popular fallacy.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>The futile cruelty of the frequency with which
capital punishment was inflicted was equalled if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>not exceeded by the manner in which the secondary
punishments were administered. Transportation was
introduced<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> in the reign of Charles II., but at first
was not, strictly speaking, a legal punishment, but
rather an exercise of the royal clemency towards
those in "the King's Mercy"; and it may be said
to have taken the place in the social scheme
of the old system of outlawry which, in former
times, enabled a capital felon to save his life by
abjuring the realm.</p>

<p>Labourers were required to develop the resources
of America and the West Indies, and to this end
criminals under sentence of death were often pardoned
on the understanding that they transported
themselves to those colonies. Several convicts,
however, were clever enough to secure the pardon
and yet avoid fulfilment of the condition on
which it was granted. By 1717 so many of
these persons were at large, that arrangements
were made<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> by which felons were to be kept
in prison until they could be handed over to
agents, who were required to give security that
the undesirables in question were really deported.
Fifty years later the practice of transportation
was common, and had come to be esteemed as
an easy and profitable means of getting rid, once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>and for all, of offenders caught transgressing the
laws made by society for its protection. Though
called transportation the system really amounted to
perpetual slavery; it could nominally be inflicted
for fourteen years, but was almost invariably for life.
The convicts were handed over to contractors at so
much a head, and shipped off to America to work
on the plantations: many died on the voyage, thus
reducing the profits of the traffic; in fact a Bristol
contractor complained that if another plague broke
out on his ship he would have to give up the business.
To prevent this waste, an Act was passed in 1767<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
which provided that, for the future, contractors should
take the convicts immediately they were sentenced,
for fear that they should deteriorate during their
sojourn in prison, and consequently fetch less
money.</p>

<p>After the American Revolution we lost this source
of revenue, and penal establishments at Bermuda,
Gibraltar, and in New South Wales took the place
of the plantation in the social scheme. At the same
time a change took place in the method of conveying
convicts to their destination; they were no longer
bought for the sake of the work that could be got
out of them, but contractors were paid for carrying
them to the penal establishments. The frightful
mortality on board the ships continued, however,
until the terms of the contract were altered; as soon
as the practice of paying a fixed price for every man
embarked was discontinued, and the payment of a
larger sum for every man landed alive substituted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>the convicts were treated more like human beings,
and the death-rate on these voyages was no longer
excessive.</p>

<p>Transportation signally failed as a deterrent, partly
because the punishment was carried out so far from
home, and partly on account of the unequal manner
in which the penal system was administered. In
the Crown Colonies, such as Bermuda, the servitude
was of the hardest description, but in Australia the
custom arose of assigning convicts as servants to
colonists. This gave facilities for all kinds of
abuses. A glaring and often-quoted instance of the
kind of thing that went on may be cited. A certain
bank clerk who had robbed his employers was convicted
and sentenced to be transported to Australia,
but the stolen property was not recovered. The
convict was duly conveyed to New South Wales;
soon afterwards his wife arrived in the same colony,
and having selected her husband as a servant, the
two lived together in security and wealth on the
proceeds of the robbery.</p>

<p>Deterrents must be advertised in order to be
effectual; the county gaol by the roadside is an
ocular reminder of the reality of punishment, but a
vague knowledge that felons were serving their time
in the Antipodes was a far less potent preventive:
indeed transportation came to be regarded as desirable
by many, who gladly submitted to expatriation
for the sake of getting a fresh start in life in a new
land at the public expense. Escott remarks that
whilst Australia was at once a penal settlement and
a thriving colony, "the strange spectacle was seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>of honest artisans emigrating of their own accord
to spots where felons also were relegated for their
offences."<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>The second line of defence upon which the
country relied for the diminution of crime was an
unpaid parochial police, sometimes assisted, and
sometimes thwarted, by the various stipendiary
establishments already described, and this combination,
as we have seen, was almost as untrustworthy
as the penal system had proved itself to be.</p>

<p>The constables or headboroughs, and the thief-takers,
or as we should now call them, detectives,
were more vigorous than the watchmen, but in
some respects they were also more dangerous to
society; the former lived largely by blackmail and
the latter on blood-money. The salary of the
headborough for Shoreditch was only ninety shillings
a year, the post was not one of honour, and
the stipend surely too insignificant to be an attraction;
yet there was no lack of applicants, who by
the diligent gleaning of perquisites and by the
industrious collection of blackmail, saw their way
to make a good living out of the office. As much
as thirty-six shillings a day could be earned by a
headborough by appearing in a prosecution at the
Old Baily, and bribes from those employed in the
liquor traffic were a still more profitable source of
income.</p>

<p>In 1815 alone, eighty thousand pounds was given
in blood-money, an expenditure that might almost
be considered as a Government subsidy for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>encouragement of felony. Forty pounds was the
reward offered for the conviction of certain offenders,
and it was obviously to the advantage of the
thief-taker not to interfere with a promising young
criminal until he should commit a forty pounds
crime; premature detection was tantamount to killing
the goose that should lay the golden egg, and
the common cant phrase of the day, when referring
to a juvenile offender, was, "he doesn't weigh forty
pounds yet." The mischievous tendency of this
system of rewards cannot be exaggerated, it vitiated
the whole police constitution; nor was there any
chance of recovering property until a sufficient
reward was advertised to stimulate those who alone
were familiar with the haunts and methods of thieves
and receivers.</p>

<p>"Officers are dangerous creatures," said Townsend,
after more than thirty years' experience as a Bow
Street Runner; "they have it frequently in their
power (no question about it) to turn the scale, when
the beam is level, on the other side: I mean against
the poor wretched man at the bar; Why? this
thing called nature, says profit is in the scale: and
melancholy to relate, but I cannot help being
perfectly satisfied that frequently that has been the
means of convicting many and many a man....
I am convinced that whenever A is giving evidence
against B he should stand perfectly uninterested....
Nothing can be so dangerous as a public officer,
where he is liable to be tempted."</p>

<p>The following is a list of the rewards, that could
be earned by police and others:&mdash;</p>

<p>A Tyburn Ticket was a certificate granted by a
judge or Justice to the person who captured and
prosecuted a felon to conviction; it freed the holder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>from all liability to serve as a Constable, and
exempted him also from many other Ward and
Parish obligations. The Ticket was transferable,
and so had a pecuniary value which varied in
different parishes, generally ten pounds or more.
A Tyburn Ticket had been known to fetch as
much as forty pounds.</p>

<p>The law being powerless to prevent crime, and
the police being unable to give protection, people
exerted themselves to safeguard their own interests
in their own way; shopkeepers combined to provide
patrols to watch the fronts of their shops, householders
armed themselves for the defence of their
houses, whilst steel man-traps and spring-guns were
set up in gardens and coverts. In consequence of
the number of innocent persons maimed and killed
by these not very discriminating agencies, Lord
Suffield, in 1825, introduced a Bill with the object
of making their use illegal, but it was not until May
1827 that an Act was passed, prohibiting the
setting of spring-guns, man-traps, and other engines
calculated to destroy human life, or inflict grievous
bodily harm.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>It is not too much to say, that a survey of all the
institutions of England, as they existed at the
beginning of the nineteenth century, would reveal
the fact, that whereas many departments of government
were feeble and many corrupt, in no department
were ignorance, corruption, and inefficiency so
pronounced as in that of police. If, however, any
should wish to find a rival institution to share this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>unenviable position of discredit, he would not have
far to look, but could discover the object of his search
in the disgraceful mismanagement that pervaded
every corner of our gaols, from prison-gate to
condemned cell. If the criminal, whilst at large,
could count on a minimum of interference with his
career of depredation, he had at the same time to
reckon with a maximum of ill-treatment if ever he
was deprived of his liberty. It almost seemed as if
the authorities, piqued at their ill-success in the
departments of prevention and detection, were
determined to wreak their vengeance on the
unfortunate few who fell into their hands. Neglect
was the keynote in every part of the penal administration,
the public suffered through the neglect that
failed to provide a modicum of protection, and the
prisoners suffered through the neglect of the
governors and warders to provide them with the
necessaries and decencies of life.</p>

<p>A description of the extortions, inhumanities, and
crimes against the most elementary laws of sanitation,
that were rife in prison-houses and convict
establishments, would here be out of place. A full
account is to be found in the interesting volumes in
the pages of which, Major Arthur Griffiths has
exhaustively dealt with the subject; but to shew with
what reckless disregard for consequences prisoners
were treated, and how little attention was paid to
the reclamation of juvenile offenders, it is sufficient
to mention the fact that in Newgate, a felon, who
had been sentenced to transportation, was retained
in England, to act as a schoolmaster to the boy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>prisoners. Under the unreformed prison system,
gaols were little better than universities of crime,
that conferred the diploma of "habitual" on the
criminals who graduated there, and it was said that
half the burglaries that were committed in London
were planned in Newgate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>PIONEER REFORMERS</small></h2>


<p>Just when the immediate outlook was the most
gloomy, and at an hour when the future seemed
most barren of any hopeful sign, unseen and
unsuspected influences were already at work; influences
which were destined first to arrest, and
eventually to repel, the increasing flood of criminality,
as well as to alleviate the hard lot of the unhappy
convict. Up to this point the annual total of crime
had ever been mounting higher and higher whilst
the tale of abuses had continued to increase. But
the malady had now come to a head, and intelligent
public attention was at length focussed on a difficult
and unpopular subject, which hitherto had been deliberately
avoided by all but the very few who had
been familiarized with its magnitude by routine, and
who had mostly grown callous to its evils by use.
When John Howard began to minister to prisoners,
and when Jeremy Bentham began to propound his
doctrine of utilitarianism, no one foresaw that the
devotion of the one would achieve a transformation
of the whole prison system, nor that the profound
common-sense of the other would triumph over the
irrationality which for centuries had vitiated the penal
administration of England.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>
<p>Foremost amongst the many objects for which
Bentham worked were the amendment of the
criminal code, the improvement of the Poor Laws,
the abolition of transportation, sanitary and prison
reform, systematic registration, and the instituting
of public prosecutors, in short better police all round
and in the widest sense of the term. Though most
of Bentham's best work was done in the eighteenth,
his doctrines received but little attention in this
country before the nineteenth century, and the
practical reforms which he advocated, though for the
most part inaugurated in his own lifetime, were the
immediate achievements of his disciples and friends.
His own special hobbies were not altogether successful,
the panopticon idea did not repay him for the
labour and the money which he lavished upon it, and
his philosophy did not prove the complete panacea
for human ills that he anticipated; but through the
medium of his friend Romilly he slew the Draconian
monster, and he pointed out the path which Colquhoun
followed and which ultimately led to the
genesis of modern police.</p>

<p>The pamphlets of the two Fieldings, and the
exertions of other minor reformers who succeeded
them, had no doubt done something to stir up public
opinion and to pave the way for a better system, but
their combined influence was only effectual up to a
certain point, and the virtue of the remedies they
proposed was not sufficiently potent to get to the
root of the all-pervading mischief. The credit of
being the first to perceive the true functions of a
rational police force, as it should be, belongs to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>Bentham,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> and the credit of formulating the details
and presenting them in a tangible and practical
shape to his contemporaries is due to Dr Colquhoun,
who, in 1796, published his famous treatise "On the
Police of the Metropolis."</p>

<p>If we think of Colquhoun as the architect who
designed our modern police, and of Peel as the
builder who constructed its framework, we must
remember that there were others who had a hand
in the good work, and that a long time elapsed
between the drawing of the plans and the erection
of the edifice. If it is allowable to carry the simile
a stage further, we may say that the Government
pigeon-holed the draughtsman's plans for many
years before the order was given for the foundation
stone to be laid. This delay must not be attributed
to indifference, but rather to necessity. It is, perhaps,
a truism to say so, but in order to carry any
valuable reform to a successful issue, thought must
precede action. Law is the public opinion of yesterday
put in force to-day, and as Professor Dicey has
somewhere pointed out, legislation has almost always
been the outcome of the opinion of thirty years
before. No better example of the truth of this
general formula could be instanced than the case
of the police reforms of the nineteenth century:
Bentham, Colquhoun, Romilly and others did the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>necessary thinking and sowed the seed in the public
conscience; a period of thirty years elapsed whilst
the seed was coming to maturity; meanwhile Peel
and the Duke of Wellington watched the gradual
ripening of public opinion and provided the necessary
legislation as soon as the people were ready for it.</p>

<p>Colquhoun, who, like Fielding, was a Middlesex
magistrate, saw that the essential need was method.
He recognized that before any material improvement
could be looked for, or any real security obtained, the
miserable jumble of wards, parishes, hundreds and
boroughs, each with its private establishment of
watchmen and constables, who were debarred from
acting one yard outside their own boundaries, would
have to be swept away, and a centralized agency
substituted under the superintendence of "able, indefatigable
and intelligent men."</p>

<p>The criminal classes, at this time, had an organization
far superior to any that Society could oppose
to it; in fact, if a committee of pickpockets and
burglars had been entrusted with the task of creating
and arranging a system of police, they could hardly
have devised any scheme under which they would
have secured to themselves greater freedom from
molestation. Colquhoun pointed out how all this
might be changed: he would have a register prepared
of all the known offenders, containing a
complete history of their connexions and haunts,
together with a list of all property stolen; he would
establish such a correspondence between the town
and country magistrates that the movements of
suspected persons might be effectually watched, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>finally would "interpose those embarrassments which
a vigilant and active police may place in the way of
every class of offenders, so as to diminish crimes by
increasing the risk of detection." He also collected
a mass of evidence bearing on the causes that were
responsible for the prevalence of crime, and proposed
that a scientific campaign against the enemies of
Society should be inaugurated, under the direction
of experts, who should be free to devote the whole of
their time and energies to the task. His proposition,
in fact, amounted to the creation, if possible, of a
centralized police, related to the general government
through the Home Office, and officered both in the
superior and subordinate grades, by men specially
trained for the purpose. It was on these lines, of
course, that Peel set to work twenty years later, but
there is little doubt that he would have failed to
carry his measure, in the face of the opposition
which it aroused, if men's minds had not been to
some extent prepared beforehand by the convincing
arguments brought forward in "The Police of the
Metropolis."</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that the period immediately
preceding the formation of the new police
was a time of expectant idleness, or that nothing
was being done beyond the publication of treatises.
Experiment and legislation were both at work;
Parliamentary Committees, which sat in the years
1812, 1826, 1818, 1822 and 1828, to investigate the
subject of police, collected a mass of evidence, much
of which was useful; and the Select Committee on
Vagrancy, appointed in 1821, performed a necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>and valuable task. Distinct progress was also made
towards the correction of prison abuses and in the
direction of the reform of the penal code, whilst
several statutes which were out of sympathy with
the new standard of humanity were very properly
repealed. The pillory was virtually abolished in
1816, public flogging of women was made illegal in
1817,<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> that anomalous institution "benefit of clergy"
disappeared in 1826, and the death penalty could
not be inflicted on persons convicted of forgery after
1830. Of new enactments belonging to this period,
the most important was the "Alehouse Act" of 1828,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
which reduced to one statute all the licensing laws
passed in former years, and which to this day remains
the foundation of our present system. Broadly
speaking the object of the Act was decentralization,
and its effect to place the whole licensing jurisdiction
in the hands of the Justices of the Peace in their
several districts.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The laws relating to remedies
against the Hundred were amended and consolidated
in 1826,<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and shortly afterwards regulations affecting
the jurisdiction of Courts of Quarter Sessions came
into force.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Colquhoun's activity did not stop short at the production
of his first book, a work which roused the
Government from its lethargy, and which even
awakened the interest of the King, he issued a
police gazette containing a full description of all
known offenders, which circulated in all parts of the
kingdom, and was the means of bringing many miscreants
to justice; he strongly endorsed Bentham's
suggestion that a public prosecutor should be appointed,
in order that private persons should be
relieved of the odium and expense of coming forward
to prosecute offenders, who might enjoy a
measure of popularity, or whose conviction might
be desirable on public grounds, even if no individual
had suffered specific injury; and in the year 1798 he
was induced to turn his attention to the question of
river-police. The rich cargoes of West India merchantmen
lying in the Thames had long offered
temptations, and the absence of police gave frequent
opportunities which London thieves could not resist.
Robberies were of daily occurrence, and the value of
the property annually stolen from ships and wharves
has been computed at half a million sterling.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Under
these circumstances, the principal ship-owners, despairing
of ever obtaining protection from Government
in return for the heavy taxes they paid,
applied to Colquhoun to help them to defend their
goods. He assented, and produced a work called
"A Treatise on the Commerce and Police of the
River Thames," which was soon followed by the
establishment by Government<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> of an efficient water-police,
with headquarters at Wapping, and composed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>for the most part, of sailors who had served their
time in his Majesty's Navy.</p>

<p>In 1821 the Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth,
who had given much attention to police questions,
determined if possible to put an end to the discreditable
state of the London streets, where of recent
years robberies had increased to an alarming extent.
With this object in view, he decided to confine the
services of the Bow Street patrols to the Metropolis,
and gave orders that, in future, the wide circuit they
had previously guarded was to be reduced, and their
energies concentrated within the circumference of
the central region. Dividing this limited area into
sixteen districts, he attached to each a party of four
men under a Conductor, and retained at Bow Street
a reserve of one Conductor and fourteen men at the
disposal of the Inspector there, for use in any sudden
emergency. The suburbs and outlying districts were
momentarily left unprotected by this withdrawal of
the Bow Street Officers; so to repair this defect, the
Horse Patrol, which in 1805 had been reorganized
by Sir Richard Ford, was further improved and its
numbers increased. The force was now divided into
two branches, the mounted and dismounted, each of
which was again split up into four divisions: the
strength of the establishment was fixed at 161 of all
ranks, apportioned as follows&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>Mounted&mdash;2 Inspectors, 4 deputy inspectors, 54 patrols.</li>

<li>Dismounted&mdash;4 Inspectors, 8 sub-inspectors, 89 patrols.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>As was formerly the case, the horse patrol consisted
of ex-cavalry men, and they were dressed
and accoutred in the following manner&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Blue double-breasted coat with gilt buttons, scarlet
waistcoat, leather stock, white leather gloves, black
leather hat, Wellington boots and steel spurs, whilst
each man, when on duty, was furnished with a pistol,
sabre, truncheon and pair of handcuffs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Only married men were employed, and cottages
were provided for them at convenient spots close to
the roads they had to patrol, their wives were forbidden
to keep pigs or poultry, a wise prohibition
designed to secure to the government-horses their
full allowance of forage.</p>

<p>The mounted and dismounted patrols worked in
connection with each other; the latter were responsible
for the immediate neighbourhood of
London to a distance of five miles from its centre,
and the former looked after the remoter districts
included in a circle with an average radius of twenty
miles; their principal routes were&mdash;to Enfield by
Hampstead and Highgate in the North, to Epsom by
Croydon and Richmond in the South, to Windsor
by Uxbridge in the West, and Eastwards to Romford
on the left bank of the Thames, and towards
Maidstone on the right bank. Their orders were to
proceed along the specified road at such a pace as
would bring them to the end of their beat at the
appointed time&mdash;halt ten minutes and then return
meeting the other patrolmen half-way; when passing
travellers they were ordered to make themselves
known by calling out in an audible tone "Bow
Street Patrol"; and on arriving at the home-end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>their beat they were timed to meet the dismounted
patrol, and had to communicate to them any news of
importance. Every patrol, when on duty, was expected
to be fully equipped, with his pistol loaded,
and his sword-belt outside his coat; if his horse
should go lame he had to dismount, and on foot
patrol half his usual distance; in the event of a
robbery or other breach of the peace coming to his
notice, his duty was to join his companion, if possible,
and that of the two together to pursue and endeavour
to apprehend the offender or offenders, summoning
outside assistance if necessary. If they effected a
capture their prisoner was to be safely secured till
morning, when they had to bring him to Bow
Street.</p>

<p>The orders issued to the dismounted patrol,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>, were practically identical with
those already detailed: the men were warned never
to go out on their rounds without truncheon, cutlass
and warrant; and they had to meet the mounted
patrol at the extremity of their beat, or report the
circumstances under which they failed to carry out
their instructions.</p>

<p>The Bow Street patrols were efficacious to a certain
extent. Their presence gave confidence to travellers,
and highway robberies on the main roads were put
a stop to; but they were of little use against burglars,
and altogether failed to suppress the footpads who
took to the lanes and by-ways when the high-roads
were protected, nor could the removal of stolen
property be prevented as long as the patrolmen were
only kept on duty for half the night. The small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>force at the disposal of the Chief Magistrate at Bow
Street, for the purpose of safe-guarding the outlying
districts, had to patrol such a large area, and their
movements were in consequence so regular, that it
was easy for thieves to calculate the hour at which
the peace officer was due at any given point, and
equally easy to avoid him by concealment in a cross-road
or behind a hedge until he had passed: a thief
named Wilson long avoided capture in this manner,
and when he eventually fell into the hands of the
police, it was discovered that he had in his possession
a regular time-table on which was marked at what
o'clock the patrols might be expected at various
points on all the main roads.</p>

<p>Twelve months after Lord Sidmouth's improvements
had been initiated, a further advance was
made, this time at the instance of Robert Peel, by
the establishment of a Day-Patrol to supplement
the Bow Street force. The new police body was
very small, and only of an experimental nature;
but it served the purpose of its institution, and
the success achieved by the three Inspectors and
twenty-four men who composed this little force was
a strong argument for a subsequent extension on
similar lines.</p>

<p>These reforms, following close upon each other,
showed that at last Government was disposed to
make a sustained effort to put the police on a better
footing, and to give effect to the recommendations
of the Parliamentary Committees, which it had
summoned year after year, but whose advice it had
hitherto as regularly neglected.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>"THE NEW POLICE"</small></h2>


<p>The depth of lawlessness under which London
lay submerged, and the deplorable condition
of the feeble bulwarks that the richest city in the
world had so long been content to rely on, have been
considered at some length, because it is only by contrasting
the security of recent years with the lawless
confusion previously existing, that an intelligent
appreciation of the debt we owe to Sir Robert Peel
is made clear.</p>

<p>The evidence given before the various Parliamentary
Committees reveals to us an impartial contemporary
view of things as they then were, and it
requires but little acumen to see for ourselves how
well we are served by our police to-day. The improvement
that has taken place has been something
more than a well-defined instance of the general
amelioration in our institutions, which was the
feature of the nineteenth century: the year 1830
saw an almost instantaneous change in the police of
London, a transformation from an inconceivably
rotten and antiquated system into one which immediately
became an example to the world, and
one which still remains a credit to our civilization.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>Simultaneously with the police revival there suddenly
dawned an unwonted era of security out of the dark
and dangerous shadows of the past: that this was
due to Peel's Act, and to no other cause, is conclusively
proved by the fact that the rural parts of
England, to which the Act did not apply, had no
share in the improvement which was at once manifest
in the metropolis. The sharp contrast between
the state of London under the old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> and its
condition under the new administration is well illustrated
by a comparison of two critical articles taken
from the leading reviews of the day. A year
before the introduction of Peel's bill the <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite> said&mdash;"There can be no doubt that the
whole of the existing watch system of London and
its vicinity ought to be mercilessly struck to the
ground. No human being has the smallest confidence
in it.... Their existence is a nuisance and
a curse"; and some years afterwards, when people
had begun to realise how indispensable their police
had become, the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> refers to the
Metropolitan force in these words: "The arrangements
are so good, the security so general, and the
complex machinery works so quietly, that the real
danger which must always exist where the wealth
and luxury of a nation are brought into juxtaposition
with its poverty and crime, is too much forgotten:
and the people begin to think it quite a matter of
course, or one of the operations of providence, that
they sleep and wake in safety in the midst of hordes
of starving plunderers."</p>

<p>The change was the more sudden because it had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>been so long deferred. When the transition stage
was over there could be no sustained conflict between
the new champions of order and the old allies of
disorder, because the latter had been allowed to hold
the boards until their charlatanism and worthlessness
were thoroughly exposed. People might, and
actually did, say that the new system was bad and
would lead to all kinds of disaster, but no one was
bold enough to assert that the old system was good.
Population had increased enormously, people were
richer, more civilized and more humane than they
had ever been before, and yet they put up with the
same old apology for police that their grandfathers
had been dissatisfied with and ashamed of. In some
respects it is fortunate for us that this was so; for
when the inevitable change was brought about, we
got a better article than we should have done if an
earlier model had been adopted, or if the abuses had
not been allowed to flourish until they had become
sufficiently glaring to demand radical measures for
their removal.</p>

<p>Of the many Parliamentary Commissions, which
since the year 1770 had investigated the police problem,
the only one which did its work in a satisfactory
manner was that convened on Peel's initiative in
1828. This Commission went into the question
very thoroughly, and came to the conclusion that
"it was absolutely necessary to devise some means
to give greater security to persons and property."
As soon as the Commissioners' report was issued,
Peel decided to act upon it immediately, and on the
15th April 1829, introduced his bill in the House
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>of Commons. After briefly reviewing the prevailing
state of insecurity, and commenting upon the notoriously
defective police arrangements in vogue, he
declared that no longer must petty parochial jealousies
be allowed to outweigh higher and more extended
principles. He then unfolded to the House his
general plan. Recognizing the impossibility of
simultaneously providing the entire metropolis with
trained policemen, he proposed, in the first instance,
to start on a modest scale, hoping that by the gradual
absorption of parishes, the central agency would become
exercised in the management and control of
the police, until in course of time it should be competent
to take charge of the whole constabulary of
London:<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> the first experiment would begin with
Westminster; Kensington and Hammersmith would
come next; and eventually every parish, any part of
which was within fifteen miles of Charing Cross,
would be taken over.</p>

<p>Most recent attempts to reform the police had
been entered into under the influence of panic, and
when some patched-up defence could be extemporised
against the danger that threatened, those
responsible for the public quiet had been content.
Peel's aims were more comprehensive: he set himself
to design a framework sufficiently rigid to withstand
the stress of the moment, and elastic enough to
admit of expansion along the lines of future development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>A nice judgment was required to determine how
far the old materials could be made available for the
reconstruction, to decide how much to retain and
how much to discard. Certain sound and well-proved
principles, admirably suited to the national
temper, underlay the structure which he was bent
on modernizing, and these, he saw, could not be
dispensed with. No mania for novelty blinded him
to the value of much of the groundwork of the old
system; and his reforms, therefore, were in the best
sense conservative, for whilst there was no break
in the continuity of whatever was good, neither was
there any deliberate retention of anything that was
bad. It is largely due to Peel's moderation that,
the more one studies the anatomy of modern English
police, the more one discovers birthmarks of its
Anglo-Saxon parentage.</p>

<p>Two months after its introduction, Peel's measure
became law. The famous Act of Parliament<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
creating the Metropolitan Police Force was entitled
"An Act for improving the Police in and near
the Metropolis." The preamble declared that, it
having been found expedient to substitute a more
efficient system of police for the local establishments
of nightly watch and nightly police which had
proved inadequate for the prevention and detection
of crime, a new office of police was to be constituted,
under the immediate authority of the Home
Secretary. The Act is a long one, but its main
provisions are simple and concise. His Majesty
appoints two Justices of the Peace to conduct the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>business of the Police Office, and to frame regulations
for the management of the force, subject to the
approval of the Secretary of State. The financial
department is placed under an official called the
Receiver, and the Police Rate (which must not
exceed eightpence in the pound) is to be collected
by Overseers like the Poor Rate. The existing
watch shall continue to discharge its duties in the
various parishes until notification is made that the
new police is appointed, and then all watch-boxes,
arms, etc., shall be handed over, and the present
watch rates shall cease. The limits of the "metropolitan
police district" are defined to comprise
Westminster, and such parishes in Middlesex,
Surrey, and Kent, as are enumerated in the
Schedule of the Act. The Metropolitan police
district is partitioned off into various "divisions"
according to counties, those of Middlesex being as
follows, Westminster, Holborn, Finsbury, Tower,
Kensington, Brentford, and a division comprising
certain extra-parochial places such as Grays Inn,
Furnivals Inn and Ely Place. A short supplementary
Act<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> relieves the chief magistrate at Bow
Street of the direction of the Horse and Foot
Patrols, and places them under the new police office.</p>

<p>This Office, as created by the Act of Parliament,
the chief provisions of which are above detailed, was
situated in Westminster and was called Scotland Yard.
It differed from the older Offices in many respects, for
whilst it was given no judicial functions to perform,
it was charged with the duty of supervising the
police machinery of the metropolis. It thus became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>a centre from which to amalgamate the heterogeneous
elements that went to make up London's police,
and from which to administer the reclaimed territory
in an ever-widening circle, until the whole
metropolitan area, amounting to nearly seven hundred
square miles, was freed from the trammels of
Bumbledom, and brought under the control of a bureau
directed by "able, indefatigable, and intelligent men."</p>

<p>The intimate connection that had always existed
between Justice of the Peace and constable was
not severed at the birth of the metropolitan force,
and the first officers of the new establishment,
appointed under the provisions of the Act, were two
Justices. Colonel Rowan, a soldier of distinction
who had already gained some experience with the
Royal Irish Constabulary, and Richard Mayne, an
eminent lawyer, were the men selected. The task
could not have fallen into better hands, and to
the energy and tact displayed by the first Commissioners<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
must be attributed, in great measure, the
success achieved by the new force from its inception.
In the course of an appreciative report, dealing with
the results obtained by the New Police, a Parliamentary
Committee, which sat in 1833 and 1834,
paid a high compliment to these gentlemen. "Much,
in the opinion of your committee, is due to the
judgment and discrimination which was exercised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>in the selection of the individuals, Colonel Rowan
and Mr Mayne, who were originally appointed, and
still continue to fill the arduous office of Commissioners
of police. On many critical occasions
and in very difficult circumstances, the sound discretion
they have exercised, the straightforward,
open and honourable course they have pursued&mdash;whenever
their conduct has been questioned by the
public&mdash;calls for the strongest expression of approbation
on the part of your committee."</p>

<p>The task in front of the Commissioners was far
from being an easy one: they had to raise a new
force, but more important still was the business of
restoring to the discredited office of Constable some
of its native dignity and prestige. To this end it was
necessary to get rid, as quickly as they dared, of all
the unworthy ministers whose shortcomings had
emboldened the lawbreakers and whose backslidings
had disheartened the law-abiding; in so doing they
had to incur the odium of causing the wholesale
dismissal of public servants, who, worthless as they
were, had no other trade to fall back upon. Nor
was this the end of their difficulties. They had to
organize and train a very considerable army of
recruits, they had to drill this force and educate it
to discharge duties requiring tact and forbearance,
they were assisted by no expert opinion, and had
little previous experience to guide them. The
novelty of the problem increased the difficulty of its
solution. They had to encounter a popular prejudice
that was almost unanimously opposed to them, and
although a false step might have produced the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>disastrous consequences, no delay was allowed them
for consideration or experiment.</p>

<p>Having undertaken the task, however, they were
not the men to turn back, and in an incredibly short
space of time they had the whole machine in working
order; the metropolitan area was mapped out
into police divisions, the divisions divided into
sections, and sections subdivided into beats: the
various grades of Superintendent, Inspector, Sergeant,
and Constable were created, and to each grade was
assigned its proper duties. By June 1830, the
Metropolitan Police consisted of 17 Superintendents,
68 Inspectors, 323 Sergeants, and 2,906 Constables, or
3,314 of all ranks, distributed in the following manner:</p>

<p>This table shows at a glance how rapidly the
parochial police was giving ground before the
advancing battalions from Scotland Yard. In less
than twelve months, in place of the five districts
originally taken over, we find practically the whole
of London and its suburbs policed by the new
constabulary. The skeleton of this force's organization
is also indicated in the above table, the details
only require to be filled in. The Metropolitan
Police District, it will be seen, was divided into
seventeen Police Divisions, each designated by an
appropriate local name, and by a letter of the
alphabet. These Divisions were then divided into
Sub-divisions, Sections, and Beats. There were
eight Sections in a Division, and eight Beats in a
Section. In every Division a Police-Station was
provided, in as central and convenient position as
possible, where the business of the Division was
conducted on a plan approved by Scotland Yard,
and common to all alike. The Constabulary force
was organized in police companies, one company to
a Division, under the command and direct supervision
of its officer, the Superintendent. Furthermore,
each company was split up into sixteen
parties, each party consisting of one Sergeant and
nine men, four Sergeants' parties being equal to one
Inspectors' party. To put it in tabular form&mdash;</p>

<p>Nine men, it will be observed, were apportioned
to only eight beats; the sixteen odd men, <i>i.e.</i>, one
from each party, constituted a Divisional Reserve.
Every Constable and Sergeant was distinguished by
an embroidered number and the letter of his
Division, in order that he might readily be identified;
the earlier numbers (from 1 to 16) denoted
Sergeants, the higher numbers Constables. Each
Constable was provided with a Beat-Card, giving
the names of the Streets, etc., in his Beat.</p>

<p>At first the twenty-four hours were divided into
two day reliefs and two night reliefs, half of the
entire force being on duty by day and half by
night. This arrangement was not a success, and
was subsequently altered, when the day duty was
performed in two reliefs and the night duty in one
relief: under this system two-thirds of the force
were employed by night, one-third by day, individual
men doing eight months' night work and
four months' day work during the year. By this
means a greater degree of security was attained
when it was chiefly required, and the health of
the men suffered less than under the former plan.</p>

<p>Such in outline was the organization of the
Metropolitan Police; absolute and arbitrary uniformity,
however, was not insisted upon, but when
necessary the system was modified to suit local
requirements; thus, there were not exactly 144
Constables in each Company, but the number varied
from 262 in the Stepney (K) Division down to 96
in the Whitehall (A) Division. The first mentioned
of these two Divisions was densely populated, whilst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>the other contained but few people, and the Whitehall
Company, therefore, which was mainly composed
of picked men, was generally available should
any sudden emergency arise in other quarters of the
town.</p>

<p>Prominent amongst the earlier constitutional
functions conferred upon the English constabulary
for the prevention of crime were those of Presentment
and Inquiry. We have seen how, with the
decay of the police system which once effectually
maintained the peace, these primary duties had
fallen into disuse, and how in consequence, the
principle of "quick and fresh pursuit" had been
neglected&mdash;partly by reason of the defective information
possessed by the executive, and partly
on account of the inefficiency of the inferior officers.
Under the new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>, however, these most essential
constituents of successful police action were reintroduced,
a conspicuous feature of the new
police being the excellence of the arrangements
arrived at for the supply of information as to the
persons and habits of delinquents. To this end, a
report or "presentment," containing the results of
all inquiries made during the last twenty-four hours
was daily rendered to the Commissioners, who were
thus enabled to take steps for the prevention of any
threatened breach of the peace. When a serious
crime had been committed, not only were the known
facts of the case immediately circulated amongst all
the members of the London force, but necessary
particulars were periodically notified to a wider
circle through the columns of the "Police Gazette,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>a new official organ which superseded the old
Bow Street publication known as "The Hue and
Cry."</p>

<p>The police constable who made his appearance in
1829 was a very different kind of man from any of
his predecessors in the same office. The new force
was recruited from the best procurable material,
and those who sought admission to its ranks were
expected to possess good physique, intelligence
above the average, and an irreproachable character.
Hitherto a variety of officers had been employed in
their separate capacities of constable, watchman,
street-keeper, and thief-taker: now, all these duties
had to be performed by the same individual. The
new policeman, also, was required to have sufficient
acquaintance with ordinary legal procedure to enable
him to collect and arrange the available evidence in
such a manner that, when his case came into court,
the magistrate could dispose of the matter without
vexatious delays induced, either by blunders committed,
or by necessary formalities omitted. The
difficulty of securing a sufficient number of men with
the necessary qualifications at the rate of remuneration
offered was immense; and although great care
was exercised in the choice of candidates, but a small
proportion of those selected were retained for any
length of time. The extent to which this weeding-out
process was carried may be estimated from the
fact that between 1830 and 1838 there were nearly
five thousand dismissals, and more than six thousand
resignations, most of the latter not being altogether
voluntary. This was in marked contrast to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>happy-go-lucky method of the old parochial bodies,
who readily accepted infirm old men, ex-thieves, and
sometimes thieves without the "ex," provided only
that they were cheap.</p>

<p>For the guidance of all ranks, a set of rules and
regulations were drawn up embodying principles and
maxims upon which our modern police codes rest.
"At the commencement of the new establishment,"
say the Commissioners, "it is the more necessary to
take particular care that the constables of the police
do not form false notions of their duties and powers.
The powers of a constable, as will appear hereafter,
are, when properly understood and duly executed,
amply sufficient for their purpose. He is regarded
as the legitimate peace officer of his district; and
both by the Common Law and by many acts of
parliament, he is invested with considerable powers,
and has imposed upon him the execution of many
important duties.... It should be understood at
the outset that the principal object to be attained is
the prevention of crime. To this great end every
effort of the police is to be directed. The security of
person and property, the preservation of the public
tranquillity, and all other objects of a police establishment
will thus be better effected than by the detection
and punishment of the offender after he has
succeeded in committing the crime. This should
constantly be kept in mind by every member of the
police force, as a guide for his own conduct. Officers
and police-constables should endeavour to distinguish
themselves by such vigilance and activity as
may render it extremely difficult for anyone to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>commit a crime within that portion of the town
under their charge.</p>

<p>When in any division, offences are frequently committed,
there must be reason to expect that the
police in that division is not properly conducted.</p>

<p>The absence of crime will be considered the best
proof of the complete efficiency of the police. In
divisions where this security and good order have
been effected, the officers and men belonging to it
may feel assured that such good conduct will be
noticed by rewards and promotions."</p>

<p>Touching the duties of the individual constables,
Mr Mayne, who drew up the regulations, went on to
say "He (<i>i.e.</i> the constable) must remember that
there is no qualification more indispensable to a
police officer than a perfect command of temper,
never suffering himself to be moved in the slightest
degree by any language or threats that may be
used: if he do his duty in a quiet and determined
manner, such conduct will probably induce well-disposed
bystanders to assist him should he require it."</p>

<p>These regulations require no comment, they speak
for themselves: but in view of the intense and unreasoning
hostility direct against the police both by
press and public, not only in 1830, but also on more
recent occasions, it is fortunate that this evidence of
the conciliatory spirit in which the reforms were introduced,
should be on record. It is hardly necessary
to add that the high standard set up by the
first Justices of the Metropolitan Force has never
been departed from by the successive Commissioners
of Police, from that day until now.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>
<p>The immediate result of the institution of an
effective police force, whose main object was prevention,
was precisely that which was to be expected:
convictions for crimes of violence decreased, because
evil-disposed persons knew that they could no longer
commit them with impunity, and convictions for
minor offences increased, because the vigilance of
the new policemen brought to their proper punishment
many a petty depredator who had easily hoodwinked
his familiar friend, the old parish officer.</p>

<p>Under the date of November 3rd, 1829, or little
more than four months after the passing of the Act,
the Duke of Wellington was able to write to Peel&mdash;"I
congratulate you on the entire success of the
Police in London, it is impossible to see anything
more respectable than they are"&mdash;and Peel to
answer "I am very glad indeed to hear that you
think well of the Police. It has given me from first
to last more trouble than anything I ever undertook.
But the men are gaining a knowledge of
their duties so rapidly, that I am very sanguine of
the ultimate result. I want to teach people that
liberty does not consist in having your house
robbed by organised gangs of thieves, and in leaving
the principal streets of London in the nightly
possession of drunken women and vagabonds."<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Nothing has yet been said about the expense of
the new establishment. At what cost to the ratepayers
was this increased security obtained?</p>

<p>Such a question is not easy to answer with
any degree of certainty. Before 1829 many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>parishes were practically without police of any
kind, and if they spent little in Watch-rates they
paid dearly in the heavy tolls exacted by "the
organised gangs of thieves" referred to by Peel.
Other parishes kept their accounts so carelessly
that their records are useless for purposes of comparison,
and it is therefore impossible to tell how
much money they wasted. The 1834 Committee,
which investigated this question of comparative expense,
had all the available material before them,
and they gave it as their opinion that strict economy
pervaded the new system. In support of this
opinion, they quoted the case of the parish of
Hackney, which was moderately well policed as
things went then. Prior to the introduction of the
reformed police, the ratepayers of Hackney contributed
£3,380 per annum, whereas at the maximum
police rate that could be levied under the
new system (viz. eightpence in the pound) the bill
was only £3,164.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO THE "NEW POLICE"</small></h2>


<p>The formation of the new police force in the
metropolis aroused the fiercest opposition
and remonstrance. Invective and ridicule were
heaped upon the measure from all sides. The
hopeless incompetence and the discredited character
of the blackguardly Charlies were at once forgotten,
nor were the prevalence of crime and the insecurity
of life and property at all considered by those
who made it their business to foment the popular
antagonism.</p>

<p>Week by week certain newspapers continued to
publish the most preposterous attacks: no story
was too improbable to gain credence. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup
d'etat</i> was contemplated&mdash;it was Sir Robert Peel's
intention to place the Duke of Wellington on the
throne&mdash;English liberty was to give place to military
tyranny&mdash;under the pretence of providing protection
for the people the government aimed at
the creation of a secret political inquisition,&mdash;in
fact anything that was at once inconsistent
and absurd was listened to with avidity and partly
believed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<p>At first sight it seems almost incredible that any
part of the nation, except the criminal class, should
have felt and exhibited such bitter hostility to legislation
that we now see had been too long delayed;
but the reluctance of the people to welcome the
innovation was not so unreasonable as it now
appears. It is easy for us to be wise after seventy
years' experience of the admirable results that have
followed upon the Act of 1829; but in that year
the only example of modern militarily organized
police before the eyes of the people, was that under
which Paris had groaned since the time of La Reynie.
Chateaubriand's philippics directed against the
French system were eagerly read and quoted, and
it was felt that London could not avoid the condition
of interference with individual liberty that
obtained across the Channel. People could not
associate in their minds a proper police organization
and the maintenance of justice, and remembered
that "injustice is always most formidable when
armed."</p>

<p>The events of the French Revolution were still
in the public mind; and many Englishmen, who had
looked on with horror at the spectacle of a neighbouring
country writhing in the grip of anarchy,
narrowly watched the course of events at home, in
fearful anticipation lest any of the causes which had
brought about the debâcle in France should be reproduced
in this island. Nothing under the ancient
régime had pressed the French people so hard
nor bitten so deep as the police tyranny of the
eighteenth century; and when the day of reckoning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>came, the one rallying cry which never failed to stir
the Parisians to an extremity of fury, was that for
the abolition of the "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lettre de cachet</span>"<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and for the
overthrow of the lieutenant of police and his gang.
And no wonder! Liberty was impossible under a
system which arrogated to itself the right "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de tout
voir, de tout connaître, et de tout juger</span>;" when no
man could call his conscience his own, and when no
fireside was secure against the paid informer. "If
three men meet together, I can rely on it that at
least two of them are on my side" boasted Sartines,
a famous Chief of police. What plan could be
more demoralizing than the one which sets the
servant to spy on the master, the son to watch his
father? What system so base as that under which
the same hand that presses yours in friendship is
the first to arrest you, what instrument so fatal to
liberty or justice as the "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lettre de cachet</span>" which
proclaims the innocence of the man who was legally
convicted yesterday, and sends to the Bastille to-morrow
the man who was honourably acquitted
to-day?</p>

<p>People in England who knew these things, not
unnaturally asked themselves the question, Why,
with our eyes open, should we forge against ourselves
a weapon similar to that, whose sharp point has
goaded our neighbours till they were driven to set
alight the torch of revolution and to destroy the
whole fabric of government?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>The fear that the continental system<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> of police
might be introduced into England was not the only
ground upon which this strenuous opposition rested.
Another factor was the deeply rooted antipathy that
the English have always displayed to any armed
force that they feared might deprive them of their
liberty. The inherent national suspicion of standing
armies is well known: James II. tried to govern by
the aid of one, but his attempt ended in failure
owing to the opposition of the people; William III.
wished to maintain a large permanent force, but so
hateful was the mere name of a standing army in
English ears, that Lord Somers, the king's minister,
was constrained to talk of it as a temporary measure,
to allay the popular irritation. Even to the present
day, our comparatively small army, half of which is
permanently on foreign service, only exists at the will
of Parliament, and from year to year; whilst the fact
that only two regiments, the lineal descendants of
the trained-bands, are allowed to march through the
streets of London with fixed bayonets, is an interesting
survival, as shewing the distaste that the
display of armed force in their midst has always
produced amongst our countrymen. If this was
the feeling with regard to the army, which was to
a certain extent indispensable and which was only
maintained, ostensibly at all events, for use against
foreign enemies, it was not to be wondered at, if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>hostility to a strange body of men uniformed and
drilled like soldiers, who were admittedly employed
to keep their fellow-countrymen in order, was more
pronounced.</p>

<p>The mildest form of police supervision was
believed by many to necessitate the use of domiciliary
visits, universal espionage, and official interference
with the concerns of daily life. Men
could not foresee the possibility of an armed
constabulary keeping their hands off law-abiding
citizens, and directing their energies solely against
law-breakers. It has been said, that had the original
police constables been first seen in their present
head-dress, the result would have been dubious, but
the glazed hat was just homely enough to save the
situation.</p>

<p>In their fears, the opponents of the police bill
underrated the efficacy of the two safeguards that
have proved amply sufficient to defend society
against the employment of any objectionable or
tyrannical methods by the members of the force.
The first safeguard was, that the new police was
placed under the immediate control of the Home
Secretary, who was directly responsible to the
Cabinet, and through the Cabinet to the country,
for the actions of the metropolitan force. The
second safeguard lay in the power of the public
press. The routine duties of a constable were,
and are necessarily, performed in the eye of the
public, and every bystander is free, through the
columns of the newspapers, to tell the rest of
London what he has seen. This facility he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>seldom slow to avail himself of, and so any act
of oppression, any dereliction of duty, on the part of
the police is discussed by thousands of people by the
following morning.</p>

<p>The Turks have a proverb "The dog barks, but
the caravan passes on"; and in this case the
necessity for ending the existing state of affairs was
so overwhelming, that the appeals, threats, and forebodings
of the opponents of reform were powerless
to prevent, or even retard, its progress. From its
first commencement the new force learnt how to
combine authority with moderation, and the storms
of clamour that attended its birth were disguised
blessings that conduced to its subsequent efficiency.</p>

<p>The opposition of the less reputable part of the
press, and the very lukewarm support that was all it
received from the remainder, were not without their
effect on the force, though the result produced was
far from being that hoped for by the agitators. The
Commissioners, instead of being discouraged, were
stimulated. With rare wisdom, assuming that the
complaints which were continually being published
against the constables were made in good faith, they
carefully investigated each fresh indictment, with the
result that, not only was the constabulary purged of
its unworthy members, but the better sense of the
country, appreciating the devotion to its interests
practised by the Commissioners, was the sooner
convinced of the advantages that follow from the
establishment of a permanent and properly organized
"standing army against crime." Some of the malcontents,
however, who, from the first, had been so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>bitter in their opposition to Sir Robert Peel's design,
by no means relaxed their hostility after a reformed
police was an accomplished fact, but on the occasion
of a projected Royal Procession through London in
1830 again attempted to inflame the ignorant, and
to provoke them to violence against the new guardians
of the peace, by the distribution of anonymous
placards. One of these placards read as follows:&mdash;"Liberty
or Death! Englishmen! Britons!! and
Honest Men!!! The time has at length arrived.
All London meets on Tuesday. Come Armed.
We assure you from ocular demonstration that 6000
cutlasses have been removed from the Tower, for the
use of Peel's Bloody Gang. Remember the cursed
Speech from the Throne!! These damned Police
are now to be armed. Englishmen, will you put up
with this?"<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The authors of this precious appeal
must have had a pathetic belief in the efficacy of
strong language, if they thought that the prospect
of a collision with six thousand policemen armed with
cutlasses would be a sufficient inducement to bring
together an armed mob to oppose them; but popular
feeling ran so high that it was decided to abandon
the Royal Procession, and elaborate precautions were
taken to prevent a riot. The day passed, however,
without serious consequences.</p>

<p>At the time of the accession of William IV., the
whole country was restless and ripe for mischief.
The irritation caused by the rejection of the Reform
Bill by the House of Lords stirred up a feeling of
violent opposition amongst the masses of the people,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>directed, not only against the Upper House, but
against the whole executive machinery of the Constitution.
The worst outbreak occurred at Bristol,
where the gaols, public buildings, and many private
houses were burnt, and the whole town sacked as
ruthlessly as if it had been an enemy's stronghold.
Birmingham was the headquarters of an association
said to consist of 200,000 members, enrolled with
the avowed intention of coercing the government by
the use of armed force, if they were unable to achieve
their objects by legitimate means. In London, an
organization, calling itself "The National Political
Union" had been established with affiliated branches
all over the metropolis: these branches, or "classes,"
as they were called, each consisting of from 80 to
130 members, held secret meetings at which the
most violent language was often indulged in: the
Union leaders were wont to insist on the necessity of
the associates arming themselves, in order that the
police might be successfully resisted, and a certain
Mr Hetherington went so far as to publicly advertise
that he would give a reward of £5 to the best marksman
in the ranks of the Union. The most formidable
"class" was the 73rd, popularly known as the
"fighting class," recruited chiefly from the Camberwell
district, which, for some reason or other, seemed
to be peculiarly hostile to the police: other centres
were less openly violent, and, for the most part, contented
themselves with the publication of political
manifestoes and proclamations. The wording of
these latter were, as a rule, more curious than edifying.
Members of Parliament were called "mock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>representatives" and "borough-mongers' creatures,"
the House of Lords was referred to as "the hereditary
hospital of incurable national nuisances," whilst the
King was described in these words: "Alas, poor
William Guelph! he is merely the puppet of a base
scoundrelocracy."</p>

<p>Fortunately for the peace of London, the National
Political Union lacked influential leadership; and this
want, coupled with the fact that, by the institution
of the Metropolitan Police, a powerful weapon had
just been placed in the hands of the government,
prevented the occurrence of disasters, similar to
those which had devastated Bristol. But amongst
the many difficulties that surrounded Colonel Rowan
and Mr Mayne, the most exasperating originated in
the hostile attitude of these Unions.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, much to be regretted that any
just cause for complaint should have been given to
that discontented section of the populace, which was
anxiously looking out for an opportunity to discredit
the new establishment. Unfortunately the hoped-for
opportunity was soon afforded by the improper
and unauthorised conduct of a policeman, Popay by
name, who took it upon himself to act as a spy, and
by pretending to be an advanced radical, to gain
the friendship and confidence of the members of one
of the classes of the union, in order to betray them
to his superiors.</p>

<p>It appears that when it came to the knowledge of
the police authorities, that speeches of a threatening
nature were delivered at the meetings of the various
centres, the district superintendents were instructed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>to send a man in plain clothes to make reports, not
with any intention of entrapping the speakers, but
in order that any projected breach of the peace
might be prevented. Popay was accordingly sent
to the Camberwell neighbourhood, and either misunderstanding
his instructions, or, as is more likely,
purposely exceeding them in the hope of earning
the approbation of his officers, entered upon an
elaborate career of deceit and double-dealing. Disguised
under an assumed name, and pretending
to be a struggling artist, he professed revolutionary
principles of an advanced character; and having
enrolled himself in the local class, quickly became
one of its ruling spirits, inciting the other members
to proceed to extreme lengths, railing against the
government, abusing the police, and even subscribing
to the funds of the society. This sort of thing
continued for some months, until it happened one
day that a Camberwell reformer, whilst passing a
police office, saw Popay sitting at the window with
a ledger before him. When questioned as to the
business that took him there, Popay said that he
had only casually been called in, because the police
had got their accounts into a muddle, and had asked
him to set them right. Suspicion having been
aroused, however, further enquiries were made, and
it soon came to light that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i> ardent politician
was actually one of Peel's hated myrmidons,
with the result that the outcry about police tyranny
began all over again.</p>

<p>The new agitation did not materially differ from
the old one: the same exaggerations and the identical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>falsehoods, threadbare already, were again made use
of. One new feature, however, was introduced in the
shape of a petition, which was presented to the
House of Commons, signed by one Frederick Young
and nine other inhabitants of Camberwell and Walworth,
setting forth their grievances with a great
parade of humility. "Some of your petitioners,"
they wrote, "have frequently seen those whom they
know to be policemen disguised in clothing of
various descriptions, sometimes in the garb of gentlemen,
sometimes in that of tradesmen and artizans,
sometimes in sailor jackets, and sometimes in ploughmen's
frocks: that thus feeling themselves living
among spies, seeking their lives, and sorely feeling
the taxes heaped upon them for the maintenance of
those spies, they make this appeal to your honourable
house," etc., etc.</p>

<p>Although the mis-statements and exaggerations contained
in this petition were patent to all, the House
of Commons very properly considered the matter
to be a serious accusation against the entire police
force, and at once appointed a Committee to enquire
into the truth or falsity of the system of espionage,
which was alleged to be universal. After the most
careful investigation the Committee gave it as their
opinion, that the authorities should be exonerated
from the charge of connivance, but that Popay's
conduct had been highly reprehensible, adding by
way of comment that "with respect to the occasional
employment of policemen in plain clothes, the
system as laid down by the heads of the police
department affords no just matter of complaint,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>whilst strictly confined to detecting breaches of the
law and to preventing breaches of the peace, should
these ends appear otherwise unobtainable: at the
same time, the Committee would strongly urge the
most cautious maintenance of those limits, and
solemnly deprecate any approach to the employment
of spies, in the ordinary acceptation of the
term, as a practice most abhorrent to the feelings of
the people, and most alien to the spirit of the
Constitution."</p>

<p>The Popay incident would not in itself have been
of more than passing interest, had it occurred at
some later period when results had justified the
creation of the metropolitan police, but happening
as it did, whilst everything was still in the experimental
stage, and at a time when the new constables
were, so to speak, on probation, the certainty that
even a single policeman had been guilty of such
conduct was a severe blow to the well-wishers of the
force.</p>

<p>The culminating point of the tide of unpopularity
which threatened to overwhelm Sir Robert Peel's
police was reached soon afterwards. In the month
of May 1833, it was advertised that a public meeting,
under the auspices of the National Political
Union, would be held in Coldbath Fields. Lord
Melbourne, the Home Secretary, fearing disorder
would result, informed the organizers that the
gathering would not be permitted to take place,
and instructed the Police Commissioners to have
the ring-leaders arrested if they should attempt to
disregard his veto.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>
<p>The steps taken by Colonel Rowan to carry out
these orders were as follows: 70 men of the "A"
division were selected for the duty and despatched
under a superintendent to Coldbath Fields, with
instructions to seize the leaders the moment they
began to address the crowd, and, if the attempt
was persevered in, to disperse the meeting. It was
not considered advisable to occupy the ground in
force before the agitators assembled, because, strictly
speaking, the police had no authority to prevent peaceable
citizens from walking across this particular piece
of ground if they were minded to, and because it was
foreseen that, should the mob find their rendezvous
already strongly held, they would attempt to carry
out their programme at some other spot, where there
was no police force strong enough to interfere with
them. Colonel Rowan attended in person to direct
the operations of the police, and to read the Riot
Act, if either of these steps should appear necessary;
as a further precaution, a considerable body of
constables were kept in reserve close by, in order
that there should be no danger of the police being
worsted in any encounter that might take place.
This reserve, which consisted of about 400 men, was
kept out of sight, it being thought that, in the excited
state of public feeling then prevailing, the display of
an overpowering force would be calculated to irritate
the mob, and to attract in consequence a still larger
crowd than might otherwise be expected to assemble.</p>

<p>At the time appointed numbers of people began
to congregate on the waste ground at Coldbath
Fields, and soon afterwards the speeches commenced.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>As soon as it became clear that the meeting was
identical with that proscribed by the Home Secretary,
the men of "A" division, after having been warned
by Colonel Rowan to be cool and temperate in their
demeanour, were ordered to carry out the instructions
previously given them. At the same time a portion
of the reserve was moved from the stables (where
the men had been waiting) to support the first party,
and it was during this advance that a collision took
place at a street corner with a mob of people, who
immediately began to throw stones, by which several
constables were injured. Thereupon the superintendent
gave the word to charge, and in the melée which
followed truncheons were made use of, and three
policemen were stabbed, one of them being killed on
the spot. Meanwhile the crowd was incited to further
resistance by the action of a man called Stallwood,
who falsely representing himself to be a magistrate,
harangued the police from the balcony of his house,
and told them that they were acting illegally in making
use of force before the Riot Act had been read. The
struggle was of short duration. The people began to
disperse in all directions, and numerous arrests were
made by the police, who committed the error of
following up their victory with too much vigour,
carrying pursuit in some instances to a considerable
distance from the scene of the original conflict.</p>

<p>This first collision between the Metropolitan force
and the people gave rise to a series of charges
against the police, which, if they could have been
substantiated, might have ended in the undoing of
all the good achieved after so many years, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>brought about with so much labour and difficulty.
It was said that the police were intoxicated and, in
that condition, had made an unprovoked assault on
inoffending citizens, knocking down women and
children with brutal impartiality, and then stunning
them with their truncheons as they lay on the
ground. Fortunately an exhaustive enquiry was
held, with the result that the action of the police
was satisfactorily vindicated. An unanswerable
argument against the accusers was that, whereas
several constables were badly knocked about, and
one killed, not a single case of serious injury was to
be found on the other side.</p>

<p>Public animosity, however, did not pause to reason;
and at the inquest which was held on the body of
the murdered policeman Culley, the jury, sympathizing
with, or intimidated by, the popular feeling,
brought in a verdict of "justifiable homicide." A
verdict so flagrantly in the teeth of the evidence
could not be allowed to stand: the Crown applied
to the Court of King's Bench, and the inquisition
was very properly quashed.</p>

<p>A Committee of the House of Commons was then
appointed to enquire into the conduct of the police,
who came out of the ordeal with more credit than
the Government did, for it was proved that the
Police Commissioners only carried out the instructions
of the Home Secretary, who, when trouble
arose, sought to escape all responsibility, and to
throw the blame on Colonel Rowan. Whatever
may be thought of Lord Melbourne's action, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>certain that he did not err on the side of over-generosity,
and the slender support which he somewhat
grudgingly gave to the police authorities was
hardly of a nature to encourage them in their uphill
task. It may be that this cold-shouldering of its
youngest child by a government department was not
altogether a misfortune, for a popular reaction in
favour of the police quickly followed, and friendship
was expressed in quarters where nothing but hostility
had been looked for: vestries which had recently
petitioned against the formation of the force now
passed resolutions in its praise, and nearly all those
parishes situated just outside the boundary applied
to be admitted into the Metropolitan police area.
Before long provincial towns and outlying districts
began to solicit the loan of police officers trained in
the London school; and in eight years some two
hundred places, including Birmingham, Bristol, Hull,
Liverpool and Manchester were supplied with experts,
who carried with them to their new sphere of action
the methods they had learnt in the metropolis, and
whose excellent work in the provinces did much to
disprove the ridiculous fables, which had once gained
credence, as to the overbearing incompetence of the
new constabulary.</p>

<p>Public opinion is notoriously unstable; and in
recent years the police have probably suffered to a
greater extent than any other institution from the
alternating favour and disfavour of the populace.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
The comparative popularity enjoyed by the Metropolitan
police force in 1834 was only a precarious
possession, gratifying enough at the moment, but of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>little permanent value. No such disadvantage, however,
attaches to a testimonial deliberately given by
a representative tribunal, especially when such testimony
is in direct contradiction to anticipations
recently expressed by an equally competent and
similarly constituted body. The 1822 Committee
were of opinion that it would be difficult "to reconcile
an effective system of police with that perfect
freedom of action and exemption from interference
which are the great privileges and blessings of society
in this country." The 1834 Committee, on the other
hand, having satisfied themselves that these gloomy
forebodings were groundless, reported to the House
of Commons as follows: "Looking at the establishment
as a whole, it appears to your Committee that
the Metropolitan police has imposed no restraint,
either upon public bodies or individuals, which is not
entirely consistent with the fullest practical exercise
of every civil privilege, and with the most unrestrained
intercourse of private society."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>POLICE REFORM IN BOROUGHS</small></h2>


<p>It is sometimes assumed that the Metropolitan
Police Act solved, once and for all, the question
as to the manner in which London was to be policed
for the future. Such, however, was far from being
the case. The old prejudice was not lived down in
a day; and the jealousy of those who saw what they
were pleased to consider their vested rights slipping
out of their grasp into the hands of the newcomers,
caused the remnant of the old office-holders to make
frantic efforts to recover what they had lost, and to
hold fast what they were in danger of losing. There
were still many irreconcilables, who looked upon the
new force as a gang of usurpers and treated it with
distrust and suspicion accordingly, hoping that some
false move on the part of the police authorities, or
some unlooked-for happy chance, might change the
fortunes of the day. Luckily no such set-back
occurred, and by slow degrees the ultimate success
of the principles enunciated by Peel became more
and more assured, and Scotland Yard triumphed to
the discomfiture of all possible rivals.</p>

<p>From the very commencement Sir Robert Peel
had declared that unity of design was essential to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>success; but when the reorganization took place,
Parliament shrank from the bold course marked out
for it, and instead of making a clean sweep of all
that was useless, whilst transferring to the new police
anything in the old system that was of value, preferred
to retain some of the existing unsatisfactory agencies,
and to allow them to continue to manage or mismanage
their own affairs as before.</p>

<p>The establishments within the boundaries of the
Metropolitan Police area that survived the reorganization
of 1829 were<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<tr><td class="tdr">ii.</td>
    <td class="tdl">The police constables under the separate control
of the Magistrates of the Police Offices,

Street, High Street Marylebone, and the

</table></div>

<p>Each of these independent establishments carried
out its police functions according to its own
peculiar ideas and local traditions. One and all were
jealous of their powerful neighbour at Scotland Yard;
and when they dared to do so, were not ashamed to
countenance the petty and spiteful tactics that their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>subordinate officers lost no opportunity of indulging
in.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that a short supplementary
Act<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> had contemplated the transference of the powers
possessed by the Chief Magistrate at Bow Street over
the Horse Patrol, to the Metropolitan Police Commissioners.
This intention was not given effect to
at the time, the Patrol being left under the command
of its old chief, Mr Day; and the Act was repealed in
1833.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> It was not until October 1836, or more
than seven years after the passing of Peel's measure,
that the Horse Patrol became an integral part of the
Metropolitan Consolidated Police, an amalgamation
which, besides increasing the actual efficiency of both
forces, effected an annual saving of more than a
thousand pounds.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The horse-patrolmen became
mounted constables, being attached as such to the
exterior divisions, where the beats were long; and
this arrangement has been continued to the present
day.</p>

<p>It took longer to arrive at a satisfactory settlement
with regard to the small detached bodies of
police belonging to the nine stipendiary offices
enumerated above. No one wished to interfere
with the judicial functions of these police-courts;
but it was highly desirable to effect a separation
between the judicial and executive branches, and to
bring under proper supervision and control the undisciplined
plain-clothes policemen who thought
more of picking up a good living for themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>and of "scoring off" their uniformed rivals, than
they did of the preservation of the peace. The
manner in which the general business of these police
offices was conducted left much to be desired, whilst
the arrangements for the conveyance of prisoners,
and for their detention when awaiting disposal and
under remand, were about as bad as they could be.
As many as thirty prisoners of all conditions, of
various ages, and of both sexes, were often crowded
together in a prison van, in which there was only
accommodation for twenty, and left there for hours
in the dark whilst the van was making the tour of
the police offices. When no conveyance was available,
prisoners were sometimes conducted from the
place of detention to the police-court handcuffed and
fastened together by a long chain. It was alleged,
probably with truth, that the officer in charge would
allow his prisoners to be supplied with drink by
sympathetic onlookers as, in Indian file, the procession
passed through the public streets.</p>

<p>Such abuses were put an end to when the inevitable
consolidation took place and the separate
jurisdiction of the stipendiary offices ceased. The
necessary duties about the courts were for the future
ably performed by sergeants and constables of the
new police, and the old staff, including the Bow
Street Runners, were pensioned off or absorbed into
the Metropolitan force. This centralization not only
materially conduced to increased efficiency and
diminished expense, but by severing the too intimate
connection that had previously existed between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>magistrates and policemen, was calculated to reassure
the public, in so far that a magistracy untrammelled
by police responsibility would be less
prone to be over-indulgent towards any excesses of
which the Constabulary might at any time be
guilty.</p>

<p>The case of the third independent body was
altogether different. The duties that fell to the
River Police were special duties, and specially trained
men were required to perform them adequately.
The Thames police establishment, which was recruited
chiefly from ex-sailors and watermen, consisted
of sixty constables under the direction of
twenty "surveyors"&mdash;each surveyor being in charge
of a boat manned by three men; their powers comprised
the right to board vessels in search of contraband
or stolen articles, and generally to discharge
the duties of excisemen and policemen combined.
Since the year 1798, when the River Police was
remodelled on the lines suggested by Colquhoun, it
had proved an efficient body, and there were no
obvious abuses or shortcomings that necessitated a
radical change; the arguments for and against
amalgamation were therefore more evenly balanced
than was the case with the stipendiary offices, but
it was felt that as both banks of the Thames
were patrolled by the Metropolitan Police, it was
rather absurd that the river between should be under
a separate organization and control. It was accordingly
decided to continue the work of consolidation,
and many of the powers previously exercised by
the magistrates of the Thames Office were transferred
to the Commissioners at Scotland Yard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>the personnel of the river force being left as
before.</p>

<p>The police arrangements in the City of London
have already been described; certain modifications
and improvements had been recently introduced, but
the general scheme remained virtually the same as it
had been any time during the last quarter of a
century. It is true that a better class of man was
employed than was formerly the case; but the
system was not good, marred as it was by a lack of
uniformity within, and a failure to co-operate with
the kindred agencies without, the city boundaries.
The expense too was excessive, and there was a
period between the relief of the day patrols and the
mounting of the night watch when no police at all
were on duty. There can be little doubt that if the
civic authorities had permitted this unsatisfactory
state of affairs to continue much longer, government
would have insisted upon consolidation, thus putting
an end to the separate and exclusive jurisdiction in
matters of police which, for five hundred years, had
been the privilege of the City of London. Such a
step, however, was rendered unnecessary by the timely
precautions adopted by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen,
who, taking the Metropolitan police as a
pattern, entirely reorganized the city force, bringing
it up to date both in respect to numbers and
efficiency, and so ordering it that there should be
no cause for friction between the city constables and
metropolitan policemen, and no cause for jealousy
other than that which proceeds from a healthy
sentiment of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>. The legislature was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>all the more ready to acquiesce in this compromise,
because the City, asking for no assistance from the
Treasury, bore the whole expense connected with
the improved constabulary out of its private
revenues.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>By the end of 1839 the consolidation was complete,
and within a circumference distant fifteen
miles from Charing Cross there remained but two
police forces, both organized on similar lines and
each designed on intelligent principles, in the place
of the heterogeneous medley of samples formerly
existing. In this same year, the efficiency of the
Metropolitan Police was increased, and its sphere of
usefulness enlarged, by an Act<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> which enables additions
to be made to the police district by an Order
in Council, and which empowers its officers to act as
constables in and for certain specified districts outside
the Metropolitan Police Area, such as, for
example, the City of London, all navigable parts
of the River Thames, and any place within ten miles
of a Royal Palace. Authority was also given to
police-constables to suppress gaming houses, disorderly
houses, and illegal games (such as cock-fighting,
prize-fighting, bull-baiting, and the like), to
supervise licensed premises and pawnbrokers, and to
regulate fairs and street-musicians.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>The success that had attended the reorganization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>of the police of the metropolis, and the gratifying
results that, on the whole, had followed the experiment,
encouraged the hope that the benefits conferred
by an efficient constabulary would soon be
shared by the boroughs throughout the country. It
would be an endless task to attempt a description of
all the various police systems which found favour in
the provincial towns, especially as in no two places
was exactly the same pattern adopted; and it will
be quite sufficient for our purpose if we briefly notice
the arrangements come to for the prevention of crime
and the maintenance of order in the case of a few
selected boroughs.</p>

<p>In 1833 Bath had a population of about 20,000,
or if we include the suburbs, 55,000; there was no
permanent body of professional peace officers, only
tythingmen or constables to the number of 110.
This small force was split up into three parts, each
part independent of, and antagonistic to, the others:
on the occasion of a parliamentary election, when
party feeling ran high and serious disturbances took
place all over the town, the Walcot and Bathwick
divisions gave their assistance, but the city police
refused to act, even when they were appealed to by
the Mayor in person. If a felony was committed in
the city, the guilty party could only be apprehended
on the warrant of a city magistrate, and, if the felon
should succeed in reaching the suburbs, the city constables
could not execute the warrant until it was
backed by a justice of the county of Somersetshire.</p>

<p>In Gloucester no watchmen were employed before
1822, and the whole available constabulary force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>consisted of the Sergeant-at-Mace, and the other
officers of the Corporation, assisted by twelve constables
appointed by the magistrates. The ancient
Court of Pie-poudre flourished until 1770 or thereabouts,
after which it gradually fell into disuse. In
1831 two day policemen were appointed in imitation
of the London system.</p>

<p>Coventry, with a population of 28,000, supported
60 peace-officers under the command of a chief-constable,
and from 8 to 10 watchmen under
the orders of an official called "the Inspector of
the Watch." In case of emergency the town looked
for protection to the services of special constables
who had been enrolled in times of tumult to the
number of four or five hundred. Generally speaking
the police were unpaid, but when employed in
quelling a riot, the constables were sometimes given
a shilling or eighteenpence for refreshments.</p>

<p>Dover had two distinct forces, one under the
control of the magistrates, and the other (established
under the "Pavement Act"), wholly independent.
The total number of constables was from 25 to
30, but they had nothing to do with watching the
town.</p>

<p>At this time Hull contained 36,000 inhabitants,
and was policed on a very economical plan. The
chief constable supervised thirty-nine officers who
were only paid for work done; that is to say, the
constables were allowed so much an hour for time
actually spent in apprehending felons or vagrants,
on the principle: no prisoner, no pay.</p>

<p>The dock companies employed a percentage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>their day-labourers to act as night watchmen, and,
under a local act, 72 watchmen were appointed for
the town and outlying districts. In Portsmouth 22
peace officers pretended to protect nearly 50,000
people, and in Liverpool, where the prevalence of
crime was so pronounced that the town was often
spoken of as the "black spot on the Mersey," the
only police force existing in 1834 was a body of 50
watchmen (of the usual type), to keep order amongst
240,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>These brief but representative examples will give
some idea of the diversity of police systems and
police expedients to be found in the larger towns.
If each borough had been left to work out its own
salvation according to its own predilections, constabulary
forces more or less efficient would eventually,
no doubt, have sprung up here and there; but
the absence of uniformity and co-operation, which
necessarily must accompany such a spasmodic process,
would have seriously retarded the ultimate
triumph of good government throughout England.</p>

<p>There were three principal reasons why the immediate
provision of a general scheme of police
reform in the Boroughs was urgently required at
this particular moment. Criminals of all kinds are
ever on the alert to find an Alsatia where they can
ply their trades without the unwelcome interference
of their hereditary enemy, the policeman, and the
formation of the Metropolitan force was the signal
for a wholesale exodus of depredators from London
towards other and more secluded centres of activity.
The smaller country towns and rural districts offered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>few attractions to enterprising thieves, and so
boroughs like Liverpool, Manchester and Bristol,
where considerable plunder was to be had at little
risk, were the chosen retreats of many who no
longer dared to brave it out in London.</p>

<p>If any reliance may be placed on contemporary
statistics, this migration entirely altered the distribution
of the criminal classes: it was estimated,
incredible as it may seem, that in 1797 nearly ten
per cent. of the population of London supported
themselves "by pursuits either criminally illegal or
immoral":<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> in 1837, the proportion of known bad
characters to the population was calculated at only
1 to 89 in the Metropolitan Police District, but at 1
to 45 in the Borough of Liverpool, 1 to 31 in the
City of Bristol, and 1 to 27 in the Town of Newcastle-on-Tyne.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
One cannot believe that these
calculations were based on perfectly accurate information,
but on the other hand it is unlikely that the
results are so wide of the mark as to be altogether
without value, and after allowing a large margin
for error, proof enough remains that the enhanced
security of London had, to some extent, been purchased
at the expense of the inhabitants of other
towns.</p>

<p>The desire to acquire wealth without working for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>it&mdash;to "live idly yet to fare well"&mdash;is the main incentive
that makes men criminal, and experience
proves that if those who live by their wits are
sufficiently harassed, they soon show their wit by
returning to the humdrum path of honesty till such
time as the vigilance of their enemies is relaxed.
"Allow the thief no rest" is a sound maxim of
preventive police; and if in 1829 it had been
possible simultaneously to provide efficient police
for all the towns of England, many and many a
thief would have been driven to exchange his old
occupation for some less precarious trade.</p>

<p>The second reason why delay was dangerous was
because of the enormous increase of population in
the manufacturing towns. Trade was brisk, money
plentiful, and the rapid development of the railway
system caused an increasing stream of workers to
flow from the country into the industrial centres.
The population of Birmingham, for instance, increased
in this way from 90,000 in 1815 to 150,000
in 1832.</p>

<p>The last of the three reasons which contributed
to make this particular moment especially opportune
for insisting that the provincial towns should
provide themselves with an improved and adequate
police, was because Municipal reform was the question
of the hour, and it was therefore extremely
important that the new-fashioned Boroughs should
neither perpetuate faulty tradition nor originate impracticable
experiment.</p>

<p>The history of English Boroughs cannot here be
discussed; it will be sufficient to remark that, early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>in English history, charters, giving powers of self-government,
had been granted to many towns and
by many successive sovereigns. The creation of
Corporate Towns was esteemed one of the highest
prerogatives of the Crown, but the powers so conferred
were seldom employed to the best advantage;
and the fact that failure was especially pronounced
in the matter of peace-maintenance is sufficiently
illustrated by the examples already given of borough
police forces, as at this time constituted.</p>

<p>Legislative reform was set on foot in 1833 by
the "Lighting and Watching Act" of William IV.,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
which provided that inspectors should be appointed
and given a large measure of control over the local
police establishments of all English towns with the
exceptions of London, Oxford, and Cambridge; this
Act was, however, of little permanent value,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and is
only worthy of notice as the first attempt to provide
a day police outside the metropolis. In the following
year the whole question of charters, etc., was investigated
by Special Commissioners, who issued a report
embodying recommendations, which, for the most
part, were given effect to by the "Municipal Corporations
Act" of 1835.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> After repealing all Acts,
charters, and customs inconsistent with itself, this
statute proceeds to create municipal corporations for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>the larger towns; such corporations to be styled
"The Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses." The
Mayor is declared to be a Justice of the Peace for
the borough, and no property qualification is now
required of him. The Common Law method of
appointing constables is placed on a new basis, for
the Act entrusts the making of Head and other
constables to a body composed of the mayor and
councilmen, called "The Watch Committee," the
members of which are empowered, at their discretion,
to make regulations for the management of the
police, and to discharge or otherwise punish any
constable found remiss in his duties, provided that
three members at least are present when the award
is made.</p>

<p>Borough constables are given powers to act in the
county as well as in the town, and are authorized,
not only to apprehend disorderly persons at any
time, but during the night may take bail by recognizance
from persons brought before them for petty
misdemeanours, such recognizance to be conditioned
for the appearance of the parties before the
magistrate.</p>

<p>Watch Committees are required to provide station-houses,
and every quarter must transmit to the Home
Secretary a return shewing the number of men
employed, the nature of their arms and accoutrements,
together with an account of all salaries,
clothing, and standing regulations for the forces;
provision is made for the appointment, under certain
conditions, of stipendiary magistrates at the request
of the Council; the office of Borough Coroner is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>instituted; and finally, the Act requires two or more
Justices to nominate and appoint by precept in
writing, in October of each year, as many as they
see fit of the inhabitants of the Borough to act as
Special Constables there, whenever they shall be
required by the warrant of a J.P.</p>

<p>The institution of special constables was a natural
accompaniment to the general drift of circumstances
which, for a long time, had been modifying English
police. Originally, as we have seen, every free
Englishman was compelled to take an active part
in maintaining the peace: subsequently, by common
consent and merely for the sake of convenience, the
performance of police functions passed into the hands
of individuals, either chosen or hired for the purpose,
it mattered not which. As long as the principle of
an inherent liability to universal service was generally
well understood and acted upon, or, in other words,
as long as the Sheriff's <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse</i> was available in emergencies,
no legislation was required on the subject,
because at Common Law a sufficient force of special
constables already existed; but when this common
responsibility for action was in danger of being
forgotten, or, what amounts to much the same thing,
when the existing machinery was incapable of giving
effect to it, some new expedient had to be devised
to take its place.</p>

<p>The first Act of Parliament authorizing the
appointment of special constables was passed in
1673,<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> and was a tardy attempt to repair the havoc
caused by the Civil War, but like many laws that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>found their way into the Statute Book during the
seventeenth century, it might just as well have
remained unprinted, for all the use that was made of
it. It was not employed to restrain the Mohocks,
nor to suppress the Gordon rioters, nor to save
Bristol from the incendiaries. In 1831, however,
began a sustained effort to systematize the overwhelming
reserve of force at the disposal of the
government of the country; this was the combined
work of "The Special Constables' Act"<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> of 1831, of
the "Municipal Corporations Act"<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> of 1835, and
lastly of an Act<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> which became law shortly after the
accession of Queen Victoria. These three Statutes
dealt with the subject in detail, by defining what
constitutes a special constable, by specifying his
powers, and by stating when and by whom he is to
be appointed. Between them they authorize "two
or more justices, upon information on oath of any
credible witness, that tumult, riot, or felony has
taken place, or may be reasonably apprehended, such
justices being of opinion that the ordinary officers
are not sufficient for the preservation of the peace
and protection of the inhabitants and property," to
"nominate and appoint by precept under their hand
so many as they shall think fit of the householders
or other persons (not legally exempt from serving
the office of Constable) residing in the parish or
place or in the neighbourhood, for such time and in
such manner as to the same justices shall seem fit,"
and ordain that they "shall send notice of such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>appointment to the Secretary of State and the
Lieutenant of the county. Specials may act, not
only in the parish or place for which appointed, but
throughout the jurisdiction of the Justices appointing,
and on the order of Justices of their own county,
may act in an adjoining county."<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Generally speaking,
special constables have all the powers, and are
subject to all the responsibilities, that ordinarily
attach to police constables within their constablewicks.</p>

<p>The years 1829 and 1839 mark the limits of the
most important decade in our police history. During
this period of time the English boroughs acquired
the means of securing themselves against the rising
tide of crime which had threatened to overwhelm
them; and an adequate defence against mob violence
was made available by the legislation which restored,
and reduced to a system, the power of the executive
to enlist as many special constables as might be
necessary for the maintenance of law and order.
Whilst the former year will always be considered,
and rightly so, as the most prominent landmark of
the great revival from which dates an almost
constant growth of police efficiency, the latter is
hardly less noteworthy. 1839 not only saw the
metropolitan forces for the first time firmly established
on a permanent and satisfactory basis, it
witnessed also the earlier stages of that movement
in the rural districts which eventually provided the
whole of England with a trustworthy constabulary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>POLICE REFORM IN COUNTIES</small></h2>


<p>Before describing the successive steps by
which the County Constabulary progressed
towards its long-delayed reorganization, it will be
convenient to follow the method before adopted,
when dealing with the somewhat similar march of
events in the Metropolis, and to preface such description
by a short account of the unreformed
county police, thereby shewing how disastrous were
the consequences of the faulty system in vogue, as
revealed by the deplorable condition of rural England
under its influence. The great source of information
on this subject is the exhaustive report of
the Royal Commission, appointed in 1839, to inquire
as to the best means of establishing an efficient constabulary
force in the counties of England and
Wales. In the course of their enquiry (which was
the most complete investigation of crime, its causes,
and the means of its prevention, ever undertaken in
this country), the Commissioners not only interrogated
heads of business-houses, their commercial
travellers and foremen, country magistrates, policemen,
and coastguards, but examined thieves, receivers,
and all kinds of gaol-birds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>
<p>The immediate result of the activity of the new
metropolitan and municipal police forces was found
to be, that habitual criminals had migrated in large
numbers from London, and from those towns where
an improved constabulary had superseded the old
parish watch, and had begun to ply their trade
in the unprotected districts. Country magistrates
unanimously reported that the bulk of the more
serious offences recently committed in their respective
neighbourhoods was the work of strangers from
the great towns. The superintendent of the Liverpool
dock police stated that about a thousand well-known
thieves, who had been evicted from the city,
were now continuing their depredations in the
suburbs and small towns near. Questioned on this
subject, a prisoner confessed&mdash;"I considered that in
London and Liverpool, or such places as have got
the new police, there is little to be done, unless it be
picking pockets; people there think that they are safe
under the eye of the new police, and will take large
sums of money in their pockets." Another prisoner,
in corroboration, said "The most important obstructions
that could be placed in the way of depredations
is a more efficient police similar to that in London
and Liverpool&mdash;very few robberies in the centre of
Liverpool,&mdash;all in the outskirts, out of the police
districts." A second cause that contributed to the
migration of both thieves and receivers to the provinces
was the extension of the railway and canal
systems, which, besides facilitating the rapid movement
of plunderers from place to place, exposed
quantities of valuable merchandise on truck and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>canal boat without protection. Merchants were indifferent
to the fate of their goods when once a
receipt had been obtained from the carriers; and
they again, in common with the shipping agents,
found it extremely difficult to put a stop to the
petty thieving that went on, partly because the loss
was generally undiscovered until the goods reached
their destination (which as often as not was in a
foreign country), and partly because the number of
people through whose hands the property passed
was so great, that the attempt to fix the responsibility
on any individual would have been to incur a
laborious and expensive system of checking and
counter-checking that the value of the articles stolen
did not seem to justify. Of all these petty thieves,
the bargemen were the worst offenders, and the
opportunities they met with, combined with the
impunity they enjoyed, attracted many thieves to
the calling; all over the country receivers of stolen
property set up shop near the canals; burglars
would bring their spoil by night to a pre-arranged
rendezvous, and hand it over to the bargees, who took
it aboard, concealed it under the cargo, and disposed
of it at the fence's shop as occasion offered.</p>

<p>Much ingenuity was displayed in this traffic.
For instance, an ex-bargeman convicted of theft explained
to the Commissioners how he and his mates
used to extract valuables from bales, casks, and
boxes without risk of discovery, every trip they made.
Silk could be withdrawn from the centre of a bale by
means of a hook specially designed for the purpose;
chests of tea were carefully opened, a few pounds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>extracted, and the remainder made to occupy the
original space by means of judicious damping. In
the case of casks of wine or spirits, the following
ingenious method was resorted to; first one of the
hoops was removed, and two holes were bored on
opposite sides of the cask, one for drawing off the
liquid, the other for letting in air; when a considerable
portion of the liquor had been taken, the cask
was filled up with water, the holes were pegged up,
and all traces covered up by replacing the hoop.
Nor did canal-thieves confine themselves to pilfering
from boats, but as they travelled the country, they
slaughtered sheep, snared game, and milked farmers'
cows.</p>

<p>The next matter investigated by the Commissioners
was the lack of proper protection to
travellers on the public highways. By this time
highwaymen, the terror of the last century, had
been practically suppressed, but footpads were more
common than ever; countrymen returning from
market used to make up parties, and wait for hours
for company rather than go home alone, whilst after
dark many a commercial traveller would go armed
with a pistol, and accompanied by a dog, for fear of
being robbed. More serious still were the revelations
brought to light with regard to wrecking. It
was proved that almost all the inhabitants of the
coast were wreckers; children were brought up to
consider the practice legitimate, and women prayed
that the winter would bring a rich harvest. When
the weather was stormy, hundreds of people would
crowd to the beach, not with any thought of rescuing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>the drowning, but only eager for plunder; as wreckage
neared the shore men might be seen swimming
out to be the first to touch any article that appeared
to be of value, for by local tradition undisputed
ownership was in this way acquired. Witnesses
testified to all kinds of atrocities. A ship called
"The Grecian" went to pieces off the Cheshire coast&mdash;the
captain was drowned, and his body was found
stripped naked by the wreckers, who, not content
with his clothes, cut off one of his fingers to obtain
possession of the ring. Even this act of savagery was
surpassed at a village called Moreton, where it was
proved that a woman had bitten off the ear-lobes
from a female corpse for the sake of the earrings.</p>

<p>Mr Dowling, the Commissioner of the Liverpool
police, stated that in Cheshire parish constables never
interfered with wreckers, and on occasions when the
borough police were employed on salvage duty they
had to go armed to protect themselves against the
hostility of the neighbouring villagers. In Cornwall,
public opinion was so well disposed towards wreckers,
and so superstitiously hostile to shipwrecked sailors,
that the coastguard were frequently intimidated and
forced to desist from their efforts to save life. It is
related how, on one occasion, after communication
had with much difficulty been established with a
stranded ship by means of the rocket apparatus, the
onlookers rushed down and cut the hawser when
only one man had been saved, because they believed
that if the crew was rescued, ill-luck would befall the
district.</p>

<p>The Commissioners' summing-up on this part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>the subject was couched in the following words: "It
is our duty to report, as the result of the extensive
inquiries we have made, as to the mode in which
the primary duties of a civilized community, in the
protection of the persons and property of wayfarers
and strangers, are performed, that the barbarous
practices above described are not confined to particular
districts, but prevail among the population of
our coasts wherever wrecks occur...."</p>

<p>Another matter which occupied the attention of
the Commission had reference to the lawlessness prevailing
in the manufacturing districts. As is well
known, the introduction of machinery, or, more correctly
speaking, the quarrels and consequent cessation
of work to which the innovation gave rise, brought
much suffering to the wage earning classes. In 1826
the hand-weavers of Lancashire rose in rebellion, and
the combinations entered into by the operatives in
mines and factories were at first remarkable for the
extreme violence of the methods employed, being
signalised by an epidemic of machine-breaking in
some counties, and by the crime of vitriol-throwing
in others. The right of every man to sell his labour
at his own price, or to cease work altogether if it
pleased him to do so, was at this time recognised,
and the legality of combination was no longer denied;
but the organizers of labour were not willing to grant
to the independent artisan the same measure of
liberty that they demanded for themselves and for
those whom they claimed to represent. The result
of this attitude on the part of the leaders of trades-unionism
was that cases of coercion, accompanied by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>violence, were of common occurrence, and the need
of an efficient police force to protect life and property,
as well as to prevent intimidation, was very
urgent. In this connection the Commissioners remark
"some of the strongest corroborative evidence
in favour of the efficiency of a well-organized constabulary
or police force, might perhaps be found in
the extreme bitterness of invective with which the
parties implicated in illegal practices in these districts
treat any proposition for its introduction, whilst they
view with complacency any actual increase of the
military force." The "illegal practices" above referred
to had their origin, not only in differences
between employers and employées, such as the rate
of wages and hours of labour, but certain organizations,
confident that they were stronger than the
representatives of the law, presumed to take the law
into their own hands, and to dictate terms right and
left. At Sevenoaks, in Kent, a colony of journeymen
paper-makers determined to pay no poor-rate, and
terrorised the local constables when they came to
levy distress. The authorities having sought the
assistance of the Metropolitan police, a small party
was dispatched from London, which, though savagely
attacked, succeeded in arresting some of the rioters.
On their return they proposed to take one of the local
constables with them to identify the prisoners, but he
was so alarmed at the consequences of incurring the
vengeance of the paper-makers, that he tried to escape,
and could only be induced to accompany the victorious
policemen by counter threats of personal violence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>Scanty as was the protection afforded to the well-to-do,
the chief sufferers under the parochial system
were the very poor. Inability to pay for a substitute
compelled a poor man, whatever his trade or
employment, to serve in person, if chosen as constable;
and it was seldom that the fees he could
honestly earn in his office recouped him for the
losses he was certain to sustain in his business.
Again, if a labourer had anything stolen from his
cottage, he had to put his hand in his pocket for
half-a-crown, or more, before he could employ a
parish-constable, and should there be no committal,
all the expense of the investigation and subsequent
proceedings fell on the man whose only offence had
been that he had lost his property; and even when
the offender was convicted it sometimes happened
that the circumstances made it impossible for the
magistrate to allow full expenses. The injustice of
such a state of affairs is well illustrated by a case
heard at Devizes in 1853, the details of which were
as follows: a poor man had a pair of boots stolen
from his barge, he followed the thief into Somersetshire,
and after a long chase, caught him and handed
him over to the nearest constable, who conducted
the culprit back to Wiltshire, where at the ensuing
Sessions he was convicted and sentenced. The
constable's bill amounted to £4, 16s. 7d., made up
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>but because the offender, a boy, was convicted under
the Juvenile Offenders Act, which only authorized an
allowance of forty shillings for expenses, there was a
deficit of £2, 16s. 7d. to be made good by the man
who had lost his boots.</p>

<p>The reluctance of the public to prosecute, which,
as we have seen, was one of the many avenues of
escape open to the criminal, was only to be expected,
and was due rather to a defective system than to
any lack of what is called public spirit. At a time
when punishments were vindictive, men sympathized
with the prisoner, and could with difficulty be induced
to appear against him; this was especially
the case when the community at large, and not any
particular individual, had suffered injury. When
the severity of the penal code was mitigated, it still
remained unfashionable to prosecute, partly from
force of habit, partly because the public which had
no confidence in the police, would not willingly
incur the trouble and danger of taking an active
part in the administration of justice, but chiefly
because the expense of putting the law in motion
was prohibitive for all but the comparatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>wealthy. Well aware of their impunity, tramps
would enter cottages at an hour when the owners
were at work in the fields, steal the supper from
the cupboard, and perhaps take a coat from behind
the door, confident that poor people could do
nothing to further the ends of justice as long as
the first question asked by the parish constable was
sure to be "Who is going to pay me?"</p>

<p>Even when thieves were caught red-handed, and
delivered over to the constable, the informant was
frequently tempted to think better of it, and either
let the matter go by default or compound with
the prisoner. In 1837, within a space of seven
months, 201 persons, taken into custody for felony,
were discharged without trial, simply because the
parties concerned refused to prosecute, and out of
this total as many as 53 were well-known thieves.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it is not to be
wondered at that from all parts of England suggestions
poured in, urging the necessity of provision
being made for the appointment of a public
prosecutor, suggestions which were emphatically
echoed in the report of the 1839 Commission. In
Scotland, it may be mentioned, such an official,
called the Procurator Fiscal, had existed for some
time, with the most beneficial results, whilst in
London, the Metropolitan police undertook similar
work in the public interest.</p>

<p>Amongst many contributing causes which were
answerable for the breakdown of the parochial
system of police, the chief was undoubtedly the
incompetency of its agents. Frequently a pauper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>would be chosen constable, either with the idea of
saving expense to the parish by keeping down the
poor-rate, or from a misdirected impulse of charity,
which prompted people to give the appointment to
an old man who could earn his livelihood in no
other way. Sometimes the parish constable would
add the business of master of the village alehouse
to that of policeman, a comfortable arrangement
which, if not otherwise advantageous, at least produced
perfect harmony between the representative
of the law and the representative of the
trade.</p>

<p>Justice, so called, was administered in a haphazard,
and often in a ludicrous, manner. In one
country town constables were instructed to arrest
all vagrants, and after having their heads shaved at
the local gaol, set them at liberty; in another
district the magistrates ordered parish constables to
tap with their staves the pockets of all labourers
they might meet after dark, in order to break any
pheasants' or partridges' eggs that might be concealed
there; a Bedfordshire farmer who had given
offence to a gang of poachers was shot in broad daylight
on the public road, and in the view of several
persons, but the assailant was not arrested, the
constable excusing himself from acting on the plea
that he did not think himself justified in apprehending
anybody without a warrant. A return from the
City of Lincoln, on the other hand, described how
an over-officious parochial constable "brought two
men in handcuffs to the police station at Lincoln
for a trifling squabble and assault, which he did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>witness, and without any previous information or
warrant."</p>

<p>Complaints against constables, on the score of
their neglect to pursue criminals, came from all
parts of the country. A return from a Monmouthshire
village reported the escape of a murderer
which was solely due to the refusal of the constable
of the tything of Colgive to get out of bed at midnight,
though "repeatedly and urgently called upon"
to do so; and in another country parish, the constable,
when summoned to quell a disturbance, sent
word to say that he regretted that he was unable
to come himself "but that he sent his staff by
bearer." At Welchpool the wife of a shopkeeper
poisoned her husband, and the same night eloped
with the shop-assistant. The Coroner's inquest returned
a verdict of wilful murder against the guilty
couple, but no pursuit was made for several days,
and then only after the magistrates and others,
scandalised at such a miscarriage of justice, had got
up a public subscription to defray the expenses of
the constable's journey.</p>

<p>The apathy of those who were responsible for the
policing of rural England produced its natural result;
and, in the absence of adequate Government protection,
people who were not content to submit quietly
to be robbed by any scoundrel who preferred plunder
to labour, made their own arrangements for self-protection.
In 1839, there were upwards of five
hundred voluntary associations for the apprehension
of felons; of these associations some only concerned
themselves with the financial side of the question,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>and by a system of mutual assurance guaranteed
compensation, in part at least, to any member of
the society who had suffered loss by theft or arson;
others took a more active part against depredators,
and revived the ancient institution of Hue and Cry
in a practical manner by binding themselves to
make quick and fresh pursuit on horseback after
any aggressor. During a parliamentary election at
Maldon, one party was compelled to employ a bodyguard
of professional boxers to protect its candidate
from the attacks of political opponents, who, in their
turn, retained the services of a band of gypsies, as
a measure of retaliation. But perhaps the most irregular
of all these associations was that established
in the Isle of Ely, where the parishioners of Whittlesea
kept a pack of blood-hounds for the purpose of
hunting down sheep-stealers. After carefully considering
the operations of these societies for self-protection,
the Special Commissioners unanimously
condemned such expedients, and stated, that in
their opinion, "the fact that they had been found
necessary was as serious an indictment as could be
preferred against the rural police," and remarked,
that the existence of such associations might, in
after years, be cited as a proof that the community
which employed them was relapsing into a state of
barbarism.</p>

<p>The prostrate condition of English police under
the parochial system should be sufficiently clear
without the production of further evidence. What,
however, is perhaps the most convincing proof, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>could be found, of the utter futility and unseemliness
of the police arrangements in rural districts, is
contained in the following plain statement from the
magistrates of the Trant division of Sussex, on the
subject of the lack of proper lock-ups for the
temporary detention of prisoners. "In case," they
complain, "a prisoner is remanded for further
examination, there is no efficient place nearer than
Lewes (23 miles) ... there are cages in several
parishes but never used being unsafe ... for
twenty years we have been compelled to hire a
man, and handcuff him to the prisoner, and they
are obliged to live at a public house.... Two
incendiaries were each locked to men hired for the
purpose, and kept at a serious expense ten days,
separately in different houses." Some sixty years
ago a comic engraving was published, which portrayed
a prisoner handcuffed to his gaoler, undergoing
a mock trial in the taproom of an alehouse
for the amusement of the village tipplers. Such
an incident may well have happened, at a time
when it was no uncommon occurrence for a constable
to confine his prisoner in a stable, or to
chain him to a bedpost, until it might be convenient
to remove him to a distant lock-up.</p>

<p>In concluding their comprehensive and interesting
report, the Commissioners (Colonel Rowan, Mr
Shaw Lefevre, and Mr Edwin Chadwick) strongly
recommended the immediate establishment of a
paid rural constabulary throughout England and
Wales, with an organization similar to that of the
Metropolitan police, and pointed out, that in order
to lessen the expense of the proposed establishment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>the new constables might conveniently perform
various civil and administrative services, in addition
to their normal duties connected with the maintenance
of the peace.</p>

<p>Shortly after the presentation of the report, an
Act of Parliament, commonly called "The Permissive
Act,"<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> was passed, enabling a majority of the
Justices in Quarter Sessions, to raise and equip, at
their discretion, a paid police for the protection of
their county. Justices who decided to take advantage
of the Act were empowered to appoint a chief-constable,
and delegate to him the power of appointing,
directing and disciplining a sufficient number
of police constables, the expense of the force to be
charged against the general county rate.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Adjoining
shires were permitted to unite for the common
purpose of policing the larger area; and if any
county refused, as a whole, to avail itself of the
facilities now afforded, any division of that county
might maintain a separate police force; provision
was also made for the voluntary amalgamation of
existing borough forces with any country constabulary,
that might thereafter be appointed in
the immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The permissive character of the "Rural Police
Act" has often been adversely criticised, sometimes,
perhaps, without due allowance being made for the
difficulty of the problem which confronted the
government. It cannot be denied that, judged by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>its immediate results, the Act was largely a failure,
and it is equally certain that its ill-success was
consequent upon the free choice between adoption
and rejection allowed to local magistrates; but it
must be remembered that the power of the government
in this matter was far from being unrestricted,
the only possible alternatives before the authorities
being, the policy of making a small beginning, and
the policy of doing nothing at all.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the difficulty
of securing satisfactory recruits for the metropolitan
police, and the available supply had been still further
reduced by the demands made upon it to satisfy the
necessities of the boroughs. An endeavour to provide
simultaneously the whole of England and Wales
with efficient police-officers would have been to
attempt the impracticable, whilst knowingly to admit
inferior men into the ranks of the new constabulary
would have been to condemn it irretrievably.
Nor was the lack of suitable material the only
reason why a cautious plan of campaign was necessary
and inevitable; the same spirit of obstinate
opposition which had been encountered and nearly
overcome in London was, to some extent, apparent
in the counties; country gentlemen, besides being
indisposed to favour any innovation that threatened
their personal supremacy so near home, were strongly
opposed to any additional burden being thrown on
the county rate. The press, without repeating the
bitterness displayed in 1829, added its influence to
that of the county magnates, and the idea that any
reform of the rural police was at all necessary was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>scouted by people who ought to have known better;
the very men who a year before had testified to the
increase of rural crime, now declaring that any interference
with the existing machinery for its suppression
would be disastrous. Amongst the many
objections put forward, some were not very complimentary
to the "great unpaid;" it was argued,
for example, that the county justices were comparatively
harmless so long as they wielded that
blunt instrument, the parish constable, but should
they be armed with a sharp weapon, such as the
police-constable was admitted to be, no man could
foresee the damage that would result.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Whilst public opinion remained in ferment the
Government was surely well advised to act with
caution, by making the adoption of the Act dependent
upon the consent of those whom it was
designed to benefit. In this way much opposition
was disarmed, and the care of the infant institution
was entrusted only to those who voluntarily undertook
it.</p>

<p>Between 1840 and 1856 the history of rural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>police divides into two branches: in the counties
which adopted the Permissive Act, the record is one
of almost constant progress towards efficiency; in
the counties which preferred to prolong the defective
régime of the parish-constable, the story is largely
one of stagnation, unnecessary friction, and weak-kneed
experiment. Although these tendencies are
so diverse, the migratory habit of criminals makes
it impossible to follow the history of either to the
exclusion of the other. No police system can rightly
be considered without constant reference to neighbouring
systems, because every improvement in the
police of one district immediately increases the difficulties
of every adjacent district. The result of the
Permissive Act was precisely what might have been
expected, and the situation may be summed up in
the single phrase&mdash;crime follows impunity. The influences
of pride and local jealousies proved powerful
enough to prevent a complete recantation by those
counties which had pinned their faith to the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">status
quo ante</i>, but they were not sufficiently potent to
produce insensibility or indifference when the day of
reckoning came. County magistrates, who in 1840
had refused to set their houses in order, were ready
to embrace almost any expedient by the end of
1842. By this time they were only too glad to
accept the services of police officers, trained in
London or elsewhere, and to entrust them with the
task of supervising the local constables. One of
the chief reasons why parochial constables had
become so useless, was because there was no one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>to keep them up to their work. The office of High-Constable
(finally abolished in 1869) had long been
purely nominal, and Justices of the Peace could
hardly be expected to devote much time or trouble
to the unpleasant task of extracting service out of
unwilling agents. In country towns where watchmen
were employed, it was usually the constable's
duty to oversee the watchman, but it was found by
experience that the business was so indifferently performed
that a plan, known as the "clock system"
had, in many places, been introduced. This method
of supervision consisted of a mechanical contrivance,
in the shape of a clock with a revolving face: the
watchmen were instructed to pull the chain attached
to the clock every time they passed any of the
machines during the night. In the morning, the
constable would visit the clocks, and note the hours
at which the chains had been pulled; but as a
matter of fact the check on the watchmen was
valueless, because subsequent inquiry showed that
one man could easily attend to three or four clocks.
In the more remote country districts watchmen were
seldom or never employed, and no responsible person
conceived it to be his particular business to supervise
the comings or goings of the parish-constables.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, an attempt was made
in 1842 to infuse new life into the decrepit parochial
system by an Act<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> of Parliament, which ordered
Justices of the Peace to hold special sessions for
appointing proper persons to act as parish constables,
and which authorized the employment of new functionaries
called Superintending Constables to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>the management of Lock-up Houses, and also the
supervision of all the parish-constables within the
Petty Sessional Division of the county for which they
might be appointed&mdash;such superintending constables
to receive a fixed salary out of the County Rates.</p>

<p>The Superintending Constable system was given
a fair trial; most of the counties in England and
Wales which refused to adopt the Permissive Act
employing trained stipendiaries to look after their
unpaid and amateurish parochial constables. That
the compromise proved a comparative failure must
be attributed not to the shortcomings of the officers
selected, but to the impossibility of the task they
were required to perform. Individually, superintending
constables were often meritorious officers,
and they proved so far useful that a substantial improvement
was soon apparent in the police of nearly
every county which employed them; but their exertions,
however great, were doomed to failure because
the very unpromising material they had to manipulate
was proof in the long run against the limited
powers they were allowed to exercise.</p>

<p>Without asserting that parish constables were
altogether hopeless, it may be said without fear of
contradiction that only the strictest discipline could
have sufficed to render them efficient; but the sole
punishment a superintending constable could inflict
on a refractory subordinate was the very mild one
of reporting him to the Justices, who, in their turn,
were powerless to administer anything like adequate
correction. To expect a parochial constabulary
to learn efficiency voluntarily from a superintending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>constable living in their midst, was as unreasonable
as it would be to look for knowledge in a schoolroom
where a scholar without authority is the
teacher.</p>

<p>Whilst this want of control was the chief element
of weakness, it was not the only fault of the system
under consideration. For effectual action, responsibility
should be centred if possible in the hands of
one individual, or at all events not equally divided
between a dozen or more participants; yet in counties
where the system of superintending constables
obtained, there was no uniformity or general plan,
but the officer of each petty sessional division took his
own line, and as long as he put in an appearance at
the Sessions, and visited the various parishes of his
district once a fortnight, no one interfered with him,
or directed his method. It was the custom for the
county to provide each superintending constable
with a horse and cart, but, even with this convenience,
the districts were frequently too large for
any one man to supervise; in Kent, for example, a
certain division contained as many as fifty-six different
parishes, whilst in Northumberland the normal
area of a single police district was about three
hundred square miles.</p>

<p>Despite its obvious defects, the system was
popular: not on account of any hidden virtue
which it may perhaps have possessed, but simply
because the small initial outlay required to start
it made it look cheap: opposition to the alternative
system, on the other hand, though it assumed
many garbs, had its root and origin in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>false economy which hopes to avoid paying for the
measure of security which it knows to be indispensable.</p>

<p>The pioneer county, as far as stipendiary police
is concerned, was Cheshire, where a paid constabulary
was already ten years old when the Permissive
Act was passed.</p>

<p>At the time of the formation of the metropolitan
police, Sir Robert Peel was anxious to make trial
of a similar organization in the country. His efforts
were successful in so far that he obtained the
necessary parliamentary sanction<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and induced the
County Palatine of Chester to appoint an experimental
force; once established, however, he was unable
to exercise any control over its destinies, and
the first rural police developed along lines never
intended by its author.</p>

<p>The only point of similarity between the Metropolitan
and the Cheshire Constabularies was that
they were both stipendiary bodies; the county was
divided into nine police districts, six of which were
identical with existing Hundreds; each district was
under the supervision of a High-Constable, assisted
by from six to eight petty constables. The whole
scheme, therefore, was conceived on a paltry scale;
the petty constables were not selected with sufficient
care, they were not graded, and they wore no
uniform; responsibility was not vested in the hands
of any one man, and internal jealousies rendered
impossible that co-operation, which is so necessary
to the efficiency of the whole.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> One of the reasons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>why Cheshire was selected as a trial ground, was
because rural crime was more prevalent in that
county than elsewhere; but although some lessons
of value were acquired for future application, as a
result of this experiment, it must be confessed that
the Cheshire Constabulary were hardly more successful
in preventing crime than the parish constables
had been.</p>

<p>Among those counties which were wise enough to
take immediate advantage of the Permissive Act, the
lead was quickly taken by Essex, which had the
good fortune to entrust the control of its rural police
to a really brilliant chief-constable in the person of
Captain M'Hardy, a retired naval officer, who had
already done good work for the Coast-guard service.
Taking "efficiency with economy" for his motto,
Captain M'Hardy was able to achieve results which
proved that a really well-managed force could be
made self-supporting, or in other words that an
efficient constabulary saves and earns as much as
it costs. The strength of the rural police in Essex
averaged about one constable to every fifteen hundred
of the population, and the gross expenses, which included
the erection and maintenance of suitable
station-houses, were from the first considerable; yet
the chief-constable claimed that the net annual cost
of the whole establishment was only £80, 6s. 3d.
This sum is surprisingly small, but not so incredible
as, at first sight, it may appear. The figures (which
are printed at length in an Appendix to the 2nd
Report of the Select Committee appointed in 1853)
were arrived at by placing on the debit side of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>account the gross amount expended for all police
services, and on the credit side, the total savings
and earnings effected by their agency. The largest
credit taken was an item of five thousand pounds
odd on account of the decrease of vagrancy, and the
second largest, one of nearly four thousand pounds
on account of the estimated increase in the value of
land, calculated at the rate of only one penny per acre.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The practical difference between the working of
the parochial system and that of the rural police
could find no better illustration than that afforded
by a comparison of the extent of vagrancy respectively
existing under the two systems. Formerly
parish-constables served at a loss unless crime was
plentiful, and their interest therefore lay towards the
encouragement rather than in the prevention of
offences. It is not suggested that parish constables,
as a class, were in the habit of deliberately manufacturing
crime, but instances not infrequently came
to light which proved that such practices were not
so exceptional as they ought to have been. We
have it on the authority of the Vagrancy Commission,
that a regular system of fraudulent collusion between
constables and tramps was common as recently as
the year 1820.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> It appears that at this time parish
constables were entitled to ten shillings for apprehending
a vagrant, upon proof being shown that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>latter had either solicited or received money, and the
fraud consisted in a compact between the two by
which the constable first gave the vagrant a penny,
and having arrested him as a beggar, claimed the
reward, which was ultimately divided between the
conspirators.</p>

<p>Under the rural police system such a state of
affairs was impossible. Constables were paid a
regular salary, and had no interest in crime except to
prevent it by every means in their power: prevalence
of crime in any district meant extra work and less
chance of promotion for every policeman concerned.</p>

<p>Of the many excellent arrangements introduced
by Captain M'Hardy, with a view to reducing the
expense of the Essex constabulary, none was so successful
as the plan of employing constables as assistant
relieving officers for casuals. The resulting advantage
was twofold. The prospect of having to interview a
policeman acted as a moral check upon vagrancy,
and the constable acquired in this way an extensive
and first-hand acquaintance with the members of a
fraternity professionally interesting to him. The
success of this experiment, with which was associated
the supervision of low lodging-houses, astonished
even its strongest adherents; a comparison of the
vagrancy returns for 1848 and 1849 (the year of
the initiation of this policy) shewing a decrease
amounting to ninety per cent. in the number of
indoor, and to seventy-seven per cent. in the number
of outdoor vagrants, the gross figures being 24,882
for 1848, and 2977 for the following year&mdash;this
result was achieved, moreover, without relief being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>refused, as far as could be discovered, to a single
pauper who was really destitute.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>The Essex constabulary was also the first to
undertake the supervision of Weights and Measures,
thus saving the salaries previously paid to the old
inspectors who were inefficient, and saving the
pockets of labouring men who were the chief
sufferers by short weight. The extent to which
false measures used to be employed can only be
conjectured; but it is a fact that, when in 1845 the
rural police of Wiltshire took charge of this department,
in no less than 14,942 instances were defective
weights and measures discovered. Further savings
were effected in Essex under the headings of, conveyance
of prisoners, prevention of fire, excise duties,
etc., etc., whilst private associations for the apprehension
of felons died a natural death wherever
the maintenance of the peace was entrusted to the
new police.</p>

<p>The effect of the admirable force established in
Essex was to compel the adjoining counties of
Suffolk, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire reluctantly
to follow suit, and in other parts of England
and Wales rural police were gradually appointed.
By May 1853, twenty-two counties had adopted the
Permissive Act, seven counties had partly adopted
it, and twenty-two counties (including two Ridings
of Yorkshire) continued the parochial system, with or
without Superintending Constables.</p>

<p>A return dated 1853 shews the progress that had
been made&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<ul><li><em>For the whole County</em>&mdash;Bedford, Cambridge, Durham,
Essex, Gloster, Hertford, Lancaster, Leicester,
Norfolk, Northampton, Nottingham, Salop, Southampton,
Stafford, Suffolk, Surrey, Wilts, Worcester,
Cardigan, Carmarthen, Denbigh, Montgomery.</li>

<li><em>In parts only</em>&mdash;Cumberland, Dorset, Rutland,
Sussex, Warwick, Westmoreland, York.</li>

<li><em>Counties not adopting the provisions of the Permissive Act</em>
&mdash;Berks, Bucks, Chester, Cornwall, Derby,
Devon, Hereford, Huntingdon, Kent, Lincoln, Monmouth,
Northumberland, Oxford, Somerset, Anglesey,
Brecon, Carnarvon, Glamorgan, Merioneth, Radnor,
Flint, Pembroke.</li>
</ul>

<p>Three years later the distribution was still much
the same, only two counties having remodelled their
police in the interval. Unfortunately there was
little uniformity of system throughout the twenty-four
police forces now established: some counties
framed their regulations on those of the Royal Irish
Constabulary; others adopted an independent attitude;
Lancashire was unlucky; Cheshire was unique;
and only Hampshire and Cambridgeshire were
humble enough to take full advantage of the excellent
model designed by Captain M'Hardy.</p>

<p>The confusion resulting from this patchwork
arrangement was put an end to by the second
great Rural Police Act, passed in 1856, "to render
more effectual the police in Counties and Boroughs
in England and Wales." This measure, commonly
called the "Obligatory Act," enacted that where a
Constabulary had not already been appointed for
the whole of a County, the magistrates were forthwith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>to cause such a force to be appointed for the whole
or residue of that County, as the case might be; and
further, that the police forces of all Boroughs containing
five thousand inhabitants or less were to be
consolidated with the police of the County wherein
such Boroughs might be situated. An annual statement
respecting crime in Counties was required to be
transmitted by the magistrates (a similar statement
for Boroughs to be rendered by the Watch Committees),
to the Secretary of State for the Home
Department, in order that an abstract of the same
might be presented to Parliament. Provision was
also made for the appointment of Inspectors of Constabulary,
with authority to visit and enquire into
the state and general efficiency of the police in
the several Counties and Boroughs, and to report
thereon to the Secretary of State. On a certificate
from the Home Secretary that the police force of
any County or Borough was efficient, a sum not
exceeding one-fourth part of the total cost of pay
and clothing for such police force was to be paid by
the Treasury.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>The effect of this Statute was, for the first time,
to provide every part of England and Wales with
stipendiary police, thus completing the process which
had been initiated at Bow Street more than a hundred
years before. The Metropolitan Police Act, the
Municipal Corporations Act, and the Permissive Act,
valuable and indeed indispensable as they undoubtedly
were, had been effective only in certain districts:
delinquents, whom the activity of the metropolitan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>police had driven out of London, found a home in
other large towns; a second migration followed when
the Boroughs got their police; and yet a third took
place, as we have seen, after the partial introduction
of rural constabularies. If it is true that the degree
of impunity looked for has more to do with the
amount of delinquency prevailing than the want
of life's necessaries, or any other factor, it is not a
matter for surprise that a large army of vagrant
thieves continued to ply their trade as long as
there remained twenty counties and scores of small
towns where no interference with their illegal pursuits
was to be anticipated, and to which they might
return after a successful raid to safely dispose of
their plunder.</p>

<p>The Obligatory Act tended to reduce crime in
many ways, for not only did a criminal career
become much less attractive after the last Alsatia
had been closed, but the efficiency of all existing
police bodies was enormously increased by the
uniformity and co-operation between different units
which naturally followed upon the compulsory adoption
of one general system through the whole country.
Local control was not interfered with by this Act,
but a certain standard of excellence was set up and
maintained by means of the government grant&mdash;the
withholding of which as a punishment for inefficiency,
took the place to some extent of the amercements
once levied against districts whose police had been
found wanting. And finally, the vexatious restrictions
which prevented constables from acting outside the
narrow limits of their constablewicks, were removed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>by the clause which gave County constables the same
powers in Boroughs as Borough Constables enjoyed
in Counties, thus restoring (in a form improved by
modern aids, such as the postal service and the
electric telegraph) a power similar to that which
our English police long ago possessed, of carrying
the Hue and Cry from township to township, and
from shire to shire "untill the offender be apprehended,
or at the least untill he be thus pursued to
the seaside."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>CO-OPERATIVE POLICE AND THE SUPPRESSION OF
RIOTS</small></h2>


<p>When the new police was first introduced, the
promoters of the scheme did not look beyond
the creation of a local force, sufficient to protect life
and property in the metropolis and its immediate
neighbourhood. No doubt Peel intended that his
police should serve as a model to other forces which
he hoped to see established throughout the kingdom;
but it was no part of his plan that the Metropolitan
Police should be extended until the whole of England
was policed by a homogeneous organization administered
from a central bureau in London. Such a
result, however, was at one time imminent, and would
have become inevitable if the process had not been
arrested by the timely reforms in County and Borough,
described in the last chapter; reforms which, besides
helping towards the general reduction of crime, prevented
also the threatened centralization, by securing
to provincial districts the control of their own police.</p>

<p>As the Metropolitan Police increased in numbers
and efficiency, it began to lose its strictly local
character, and to become a national police. Up to a
certain point this was to the public advantage, but it
would have been calamitous if the tendency had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>allowed to continue beyond that point. It is obvious,
however, that after the failure of the Permissive Act
in 1839, the retention of local control, so desirable
on many grounds, was only rendered possible by
making the abolition of the parochial system universally
compulsory.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the powers of making additions
to the Metropolitan District, acquired in 1839,<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> were
only taken advantage of to a very small extent, and
the growth of the Metropolitan Police was almost
entirely confined within the limits originally assigned
to it. In 1840 the Houses of Parliament and the
London Docks were taken over; next came the
Woolwich and Deptford Yards; Woolwich Arsenal,
and Greenwich were incorporated in 1843; then the
Tower of London, and finally the Royal Dockyards
(Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham, and Pembroke
Dock) were policed by the Metropolitan force in
1860. The entire establishment, which in June
1830 was 3314 of all ranks, had risen to 5625 in
1852, and ten years afterwards a new division (X)
was created to deal with the crowds which were
expected to visit the second International Exhibition.
In 1864 the total strength was 7113.
Colonel Rowan resigned in 1850, and in 1856
the two Commissioners were replaced by one
Commissioner (Sir R. Mayne) and two Assistant
Commissioners.</p>

<p>At first no steps were taken to fill the gap caused
by the disappearance of the Bow Street Runner, and
the Popay incident discouraged the Commissioners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>from venturing on what was felt to be dangerous
ground. The lack of a detective service was a great
source of weakness, and so in 1842 a new department,
especially devoted to this very necessary branch
of police work, was instituted by Sir James Graham,
and attached to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>A small staff was selected out of the uniform
branch to form a nucleus. At first the department
only consisted of three inspectors and nine sergeants;
soon afterwards six constables were added, and
gradually the numbers were increased until in 1878
the whole detective service was reorganized, and the
Criminal Investigation Department created.</p>

<p>At the time when the Metropolitan force was the
only efficient police in the kingdom, individual
officers, it may be remembered, were often sent to
the provinces, on loan or permanently, to assist in
the formation of similar organizations in other parts
of England; this of course was right and proper,
and was attended by the best results. Subsequently,
the practice arose of temporarily drafting
large bodies of London policemen to keep the peace
in distant districts wherever disturbances were feared,
a course of action sound enough in theory perhaps,
but seldom found effectual when put to the test of
experience. An English mob quickly resents high-handed
interference, and will not tolerate at the
hands of strangers the same degree of repression it
would quietly submit to from local peace officers.</p>

<p>Several examples might be given of the ill-success
which has almost invariably attended the employment
of London police in the provinces; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>following is selected as a particularly well-defined
instance. In the summer of 1839 a force of Metropolitan
policemen, about ninety strong, were dispatched
to Birmingham, to over-awe the turbulent crowds
which, it was feared, might proceed to extremities
if their demands were not complied with. When
the police arrived in the town, a noisy public meeting
was in progress at the Bull Ring, but no overt
act of violence had as yet been committed. The
Superintendent in charge of the constables peremptorily
ordered the crowd to disperse; his summons
was as positively disregarded, and within five
minutes blows were exchanged. In the melée
which followed, the police were worsted, and the
situation was barely saved by the opportune appearance
of the military. On the ensuing Monday
evening, a second conflict took place, in which the
policemen were victorious, though at the expense
of an increase of bitterness on both sides. A
spurious semblance of peace having thus been
restored, fifty constables returned to London, and
only forty were left to deal with any recrudescence
of disorder; for this they had not long to wait, as
an attempt to break up a public meeting, a few
days later, was followed by the most serious consequences.
After destroying some iron palisading
which surrounded the Nelson Monument, the crowd,
now animated by a worse temper than before, made
weapons of part of the débris, and drove the small
force of constables to take refuge in the police-yard.
For the next hour and a half the town was
at the mercy of the rioters, who, having begun by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>smashing lamps and windows, ended by pillaging
shops and warehouses.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Eventually the police
charged the mob with drawn cutlasses, and, assisted
by dragoons, got the upper hand; shortly afterwards
the police were withdrawn, and the task of
keeping order was entrusted to a strong levy of
special constables locally enrolled, who succeeded
in maintaining the peace where their more professional
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrères</i> had failed. There is little doubt
but that these riots might have been avoided, or at
least mitigated, had no strangers been introduced to
quell them.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>An isolated fact seldom proves anything; but it
will be allowed, without the production of additional
evidence, that the Birmingham fiasco affords sufficient
proof that the Metropolitan Police had not
yet learnt the art of managing an angry crowd.
There are, no doubt, many occasions on which it
is desirable to transfer bodies of police from one
place to another in order to concentrate the forces
of law and order at some threatened or strategic
point, but in so doing the danger to be apprehended
from the resulting increase of local animus, ought
to be taken into account, and adequately provided
for.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>
<p>The valuable, if not indispensable, nature of the
services which may be rendered by Special Constables
when directed towards the suppression of
riots, already indicated at Birmingham in 1839,
was more fully exemplified in 1848, when the
Chartists assembled at Kennington Common,
threatened to descend upon London. The fear
that the Metropolis might be subjected to an
access of anarchy similar to that which bestowed
an evil notoriety on the Gordon Riots, gave rise
to preparations for defence on an unprecedented
scale. At this crisis not less than two hundred
thousand citizens enrolled themselves as Special
Constables; the Metropolitan Police were told off
to guard the bridges; and all available troops were
held in reserve, mostly in houses on the Middlesex
side of the river. The Duke of Wellington took
command of this huge police army, and so perfect
were his arrangements that, without the display of
a single redcoat, the rioters outside dared not
advance to the attack, and their sympathisers
within dared not make any diversion in their
favour.</p>

<p>The whole subject of the policing of riotous and
riotously disposed crowds is of the highest importance;
but being a science in itself, its many aspects
cannot be discussed in a book which only professes
to tell briefly the story of police development in this
country. At the same time, if we are to appreciate
correctly the bearing of one fact upon another, if we
hope to draw intelligent conclusions, it is impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>to avoid altogether what may be called the semi-scientific
side of the question. In order to estimate
the efficiency of any police force, to decide, for
example, whether its failures are due to faulty
organization or to bad generalship,&mdash;it is not
sufficient to have an acquaintance with a mass of
facts, dates and figures, but a key is required to read
the cipher, some guide is necessary to assist in
arranging the known factors in the order of their
relative importance.</p>

<p>An indifferently directed force may be capable
of dealing in detail with isolated offenders; but the
problem of pacifying a combination of peace breakers
may induce a strain which will find out the faulty
link in all but the most highly tempered organizations.
Just as a concerted breach of the peace by
a number of persons is disproportionately more
serious than an independent breach by any individual,
so also do police duties take a higher
range as soon as it becomes necessary to concentrate
the energies of a number of constables for the attainment
of a common object. If he is to employ his
constables to the best advantage, a superior officer
of police must have some knowledge of the general
laws that sway men when they are assembled together
in great numbers, those "volcanic forces"
which, in the words of an American writer, "lie
smouldering in all ignorant masses."</p>

<p>Men have a gregarious instinct which, under the
influence of excitement, induces them to herd together
without any definite object and often at
great inconvenience to themselves; the progress of
the resulting congestion is normal until a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>point is reached, the point at which entirely new
forces begin to act. When this moment arrives, all
self-control is repudiated, decent and orderly men
become desperadoes, cowards are inspired by a
senseless bravado, the calm reason of common-sense
gives place to the insanity of licence, and unless the
demoralising tendency is checked, a crowd rapidly
reaches the level of its most degraded constituent.
The explanation of these phenomena is probably to
be found in an excessive spirit of emulation aroused
under conditions of excitement, which makes a man
feel that the responsibility for his actions is no
longer to be borne by himself, but will be shared by
the multitude in which he has merged his identity.
It is the business of the police to exhaust every art
in a sustained effort to prevent the ferment from
reaching the critical stage, and to watch the crowd
so narrowly that the first symptom of violence
may instantly be suppressed. This can best be
accomplished by local constables who are acquainted
with the persons and names of individual members
of the crowd, while it is of even greater moment
that the constabulary should not be the first to give
offence, or contribute to a breach of the peace by
the use of exasperating language or aggressive
action.</p>

<p>The problem before the policeman operating
against a riotously disposed crowd is somewhat
similar to that which confronts the soldier in the
face of the enemy, and it was on this account that the
Metropolitan force was given a semi-military organization.
In some respects, however, the policeman's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>task is the more difficult of the two, chiefly because
he has to strive for peace whilst actually engaged in
conflict; the soldier at least enjoys the advantage
of knowing his own comrades, whereas the constable
is often unable to distinguish friends from foes, and
continually runs the risk of converting the former
into the latter. Whilst the greatest possible latitude
must be allowed to individual constables, the secret
of success lies in mutual, not in independent action,
and for mutual action to exist, there must be discipline
and intelligent direction. When the use of
force can no longer be delayed, the plan adopted by
the officer in command should be easy of accomplishment,
simple of comprehension, and its success
should leave the law-breakers at a strategical disadvantage
sufficiently obvious to convince them of
the futility of further resistance. Nothing is so fatal
as vacillation: partial success leads on a mob to the
commission of fresh excesses, partial repression only
aggravates it. It is far better to leave a crowd
altogether alone, than to sustain even an apparent
defeat. Force is no remedy unless it is unswervingly
and unhesitatingly applied; and as it is comparatively
immaterial in what direction repression is exercised
so long as it is consistent and irresistible, it is usually
good policy to divert the energies of the mob towards
the line of least resistance. It is more efficacious,
for example, to keep a crowd moving in some
definite direction, than to dissipate the strength of
the police in attempts to arrest ring-leaders, to seize
banners or the like, which may degenerate into a
series of disconnected single combats not uniformly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>favourable to authority. Any apparently uncalled-for
attack may convey the impression of wanton
outrage, and so tend to defeat the object in view, by
increasing that state of irritation and excitement
which it is the principal duty of the police to allay.
Many branches of police science which to-day are in
the common knowledge were unheard of and unsuspected
during the first half of the nineteenth
century. This is particularly the case with regard
to that part of the constable's duty which has to do
with the management of crowds: before 1830 there
were only two methods of dealing with a riotous
mob, the first was to leave it severely alone, and the
second was to allow a regiment of cavalry to trample
it into submission. No government worthy of the
name is justified in adopting a policy of non-interference
at a time when the lives and property
of law-abiding citizens are in preventible jeopardy,
and the disastrous consequences that may follow
upon the employment of the second method were
sufficiently advertised (to cite two instances only)
by the Bristol Riots and the so-called Peterloo
Massacre.</p>

<p>London police and London crowds are now
renowned all over the world, the former for the
general excellence of their arrangements, and the
latter for their almost invariable good humour.
Perhaps the credit is not always fairly apportioned,
for it is not too much to say that the good humour
of the crowd is more often due to the admirable
tact of the police than to any inherent virtue that
exclusively resides in Londoners. At first the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>police were hardly more successful in suppressing
riots than the soldiers had been: in Birmingham as
at Coldbath Fields, events shewed that the unpopularity
of the new constabulary went far to neutralize
the undoubted superiority naturally possessed by a
civil, over a military, force for the purposes of peace
maintenance. As time went on, and as police and
public came to understand each other, riots became
less frequent, and conflicts less bitter, until the
harmony which now so happily exists was arrived at.
If it is allowable to talk of a turning-point in a
process which is gradual, this point was reached
soon after the disturbances which commonly go by
the name of the Sunday-Trading-Bill Riots. Though
not accompanied by any loss of life, nor followed by
those unsparing attacks on the conduct of the police
that had embittered the Coldbath Fields controversy,
the collision which took place in July 1855, between
the Metropolitan Police and a mixed London crowd,
were serious enough to stir up much of the old
animosity, and to prove that, if the policeman was
no longer an object of active dislike to his fellow-citizens,
neither could he as yet lay claim to any
great measure of popularity.</p>

<p>The disturbances in question arose out of the
following circumstances. Lord Robert Grosvenor
had introduced a bill, the object of which was to
prevent all buying and selling within the City of
London and metropolitan police district on Sundays.
Popular feeling, which ran high against the measure,
found expression in a variety of ways, some serious
and some serio-comic. The point of view of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>masses was not badly summed up in these
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Sublime decree, by which our souls to save</div>
      <div class="verse">No Sunday tankards foam, no barbers shave,</div>
      <div class="verse">And chins unmown, and throats unslaked display,</div>
      <div class="verse">His Lordship's reverence for the Sabbath day."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately the opponents of the obnoxious
bill did not confine themselves to versification, but
caused handbills to be circulated, announcing that on
the 24th of June, an open-air meeting would be held
in Hyde Park "to see how religiously the aristocracy
observe the Sabbath, and how careful they are not to
work their servants or their cattle on that day." The
result of this manifesto was that, at the time
mentioned, a mob assembled near the Serpentine,
but the demonstration did not assume serious
proportions, the crowd contenting themselves
with hooting and jeering at those who were
taking their afternoon ride or drive in the
Park.</p>

<p>Throughout the following week, certain persons
continued the agitation, and, by means of placards,
summoned their sympathisers to meet them on the
next Sunday in Hyde Park, where it was announced
that "the open air concert and monster fête, under
the patronage of the Leave-us-alone Club will be
repeated." Another appeal was of a more personal
nature and ran as follows, "Let us go to Church
with Lord Robert Grosvenor next Sunday morning.
We can attend his lordship in Park Lane at half
past ten, go to Church with him, then go home to
dinner, and be back in time to see our friends in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>Hyde Park. Come in your best clothes, as his
lordship is very particular."</p>

<p>These handbills and placards having been brought
to his notice, Sir Richard Mayne replied by publishing
a proclamation requesting well-disposed persons
not to attend the proposed meeting, at the same
time warning all concerned that steps would be
taken by the police to prevent the meeting being
held, and that, if necessary, force would be employed
to maintain the peace.</p>

<p>Undeterred by this notice, thousands of people
entered the Park on the afternoon of Sunday the
1st of July, drawn thither, some by curiosity, some
for purposes of recreation, some with the fixed
determination of resisting the police. Certain precautionary
arrangements were made by the Chief
Commissioner, and orders were issued to the effect
that any persons shouting or frightening horses, or
attempting to address the crowd, were to be cautioned
as to the consequences of their action and required
to desist, the police being instructed to remove, and
if necessary take into custody, any who persistently
refused to obey their orders.</p>

<p>As on the previous Sunday, the disturbances
commenced with hooting and shouting, but the
police who, in obedience to orders, were lying down
on the grass, did not interfere; at about half past
three, the crowd began to assume a more threatening
attitude, and things began to look serious. A dense
mob was gathered along the railings and across the
carriage way, stones were thrown at carriages, some
wooden hurdles were broken up, and the fragments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>used as missiles, whilst the crowd continued to hoot,
whistle and make discordant noises, with the object
of frightening the horses.</p>

<p>The Superintendent in charge, thinking that the
time for vigorous action had arrived, ordered the
police to draw their truncheons and clear the roadway.
Whilst this order was being carried out, a
considerable number of people who did not give
way with sufficient promptitude were struck and
some knocked down. The mob now turned upon
the police, making insulting remarks, throwing stones,
and repeatedly attempting to break the line of constables,
who retaliated by making short rushes and
taking into custody all who offered resistance.
Victory eventually rested with the police, but
desultory fighting continued throughout the afternoon,
and it was not until six o'clock in the evening
that the commotion in the neighbourhood of the
Drive subsided.</p>

<p>Whilst the main crowd was being dispersed, a
mob some 400 strong, with cries of "Now to Lord
Robert Grosvenor's," left the park, and proceeded to
Park Street, and at the same moment another body
made their way to the Magazine Barracks, where
they amused themselves by throwing stones at a
small party of Grenadiers stationed there. The
sergeant in command sent to the police for assistance
which was promptly rendered, and quiet was
soon restored.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the constables in Park Street were
endeavouring to persuade the crowd, who had
gathered in force in front of Lord Robert's house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>to disperse quietly, but when their efforts proved
of no avail, and when cries of "Chuck him out"
and threats of violence were raised, the reserves
previously stationed at Stanhope Gate were moved up,
and the street cleared by force. In this encounter
truncheons were again used, and numerous minor
injuries inflicted, but only one arrest was made.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock the police were withdrawn, all
disturbance being at an end. In the course of the
day forty-nine policemen were reported hurt, and on
the other side seventy-two persons were taken into
custody and removed to Vine Street Police Station,
ten of them being charged with felony, and the
remaining sixty-two with riotous conduct or with
assaults on the police. Unfortunately the accommodation
at Vine Street was altogether insufficient for such
a large number of prisoners, the cells ordinarily in
use were soon filled, and then recourse was had to an
underground room, formerly the place of confinement
attached to the old parish watch-house. Into this
prison, which was dark and badly ventilated, were
crowded forty-three persons, ten of whom were subsequently
removed, but the remaining thirty-three had
to spend the night (which happened to be unusually
sultry), standing up, or lying on the damp floor as best
they could. Many of the prisoners were respectable
people, unused to dirt and discomfort, and their
sufferings must have been considerable.</p>

<p>The Inspector in charge of the Vine Street Station,
somewhat tardily communicating with Sir Richard
Mayne, informed him of the overcrowded state of
the cells, with the result that thirty-one prisoners out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>of the original seventy-two were removed to neighbouring
stations by order of the Chief Commissioner.
In the course of the next two days, all the accused
were brought before the magistrates, when twenty-nine,
or nearly half the number, were discharged, the
remainder being fined or sentenced to short terms of
imprisonment.</p>

<p>The conduct of the police in Hyde Park, and the
treatment of the prisoners at Vine Street, having
given rise to serious allegations and to much adverse
comment in the public press, the Government decided
to hold an inquiry into the matter. Three Commissioners
were appointed, and given full powers to
investigate and report upon the occurrences of the
1st of July and the following days. In the course
of the inquiry, several attempts were made to discredit
Sir Richard Mayne; some accused him of
slackness for not personally directing the police in
the park, whilst others held that he was over-officious
in not leaving the crowd alone altogether. The
responsibility for the overcrowding at Vine Street
was laid to his charge, and it was suggested that he
failed in his duty, in that he did not go to the police
station, and, by virtue of the powers vested in him as
a Justice of the Peace, admit to bail those prisoners
who were not charged with felony, and who might
be able to find sufficient guarantee for their future
appearance.</p>

<p>Of these charges, which were made by people who
seemed to think that any stone was good enough to
throw at the chief officer of police, the two first, when
taken together, were mutually destructive, besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>being silly when considered separately; whilst the
suggestion that Sir Richard Mayne ought to have
admitted certain of the accused to bail, was not to
the point, because it had been clearly laid down by
Statute when the office was first created, that any
exercise of the powers of a Justice by the Chief Commissioner
of Police was to be strictly confined to his
duties connected with the preservation of the peace.</p>

<p>The net result of the labours of Her Majesty's
Commissioners was to establish, beyond a doubt, that
certain constables had been guilty of unnecessary
violence; that the Superintendent in charge, losing his
head, or his temper, or both, had authorized stronger
measures than the circumstances of the case warranted;
and that blame attached to the authorities at
Vine Street for the mismanagement which caused
the detention of a far larger number of prisoners
than there was accommodation for at that station.
On the other hand, it was proved that the large
majority of the police had acted with moderation
and good temper throughout a long and trying day
in spite of the continued attempts of the crowd to
harass and annoy them; and that the measures
adopted for the preservation of the peace had on
the whole been successful, in so far that a mob
many thousands strong, bent on mischief, had been
effectually controlled and prevented from doing any
material damage worth mentioning.</p>

<p>From the evidence as a whole, it is clear that the
accusing witnesses (and they were very numerous,),
must have been guilty of much exaggeration when
describing the violence with which they said the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>police had acted; since in a conflict lasting several
hours, in which it was alleged the constabulary
used their truncheons unmercifully, sparing neither
age nor sex, no life was lost, no limb was broken,
nor was any permanent injury inflicted. On the
other hand, many witnesses voluntarily came forward
to testify to the good behaviour of the police,
not only on this particular occasion, but generally in
all their dealings with the public.</p>

<p>The promptitude with which the inquiry was
granted, and the thorough and impartial manner
in which it was carried out, was attended by the
happiest results, and did much to foster friendly
relations in the future between police and public;
the latter were reassured that Government would
not tolerate, much less countenance, any excesses
committed by the police, upon whom again it was
impressed that even a disorderly mob must be treated
with a certain amount of consideration, and that
high-handed interference would lead to the punishment
of the offending constables.</p>

<p>A minor improvement which originated from this
inquiry may, in passing, be noticed. Hitherto a constable's
number had been surrounded by a scroll of
embroidery that made it difficult to decipher except
at very close quarters, so that identification was often
rendered impossible: to rectify this, the plain metal
figures now worn by constables on collar and helmet
were introduced.</p>

<p>The Sunday-Trading Bill riots were quite unimportant
as riots, and yet their influence upon
the future of the police was very great, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>the inquiry which followed illuminated a question
that had been obscured by ignorance and prejudice,
causing misconceptions to be removed on both sides,
and a better understanding and mutual appreciation
to be substituted, with the result that the metropolitan
force soon began to be popular in quarters
where it had previously been hated. The best proof
of its efficiency, so far as the management of crowds
is concerned, may be found in the fact that, during
the first forty years of its existence, the peace was
so well maintained, that the damage done to property
by rioters was quite insignificant, and this
without the intervention of the military; whilst in
witness of the moderation of the methods employed
by the police in the attainment of this result, it need
only be stated, that in every conflict which occurred
during the same period, the personal injuries sustained
by the aggressors were invariably less severe
than those suffered by the constables, though the
latter were all men of exceptionally fine physique,
and were armed with truncheons. In the course of
the Reform riot which took place in Hyde Park in the
year 1868, two hundred and sixty-five policemen were
wounded out of a total of 1613 actually on duty,
"and one Superintendent, two Inspectors, nine sergeants,
and thirty-three constables were so severely
injured as to be rendered unfit for duty, many for
life," yet "the police behaved with the most admirable
moderation and not a single case of unnecessary
violence was proved against them."<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>There is a saying that the strength of the Man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>in Blue lies in the fact that he has the Man in
Red behind him. This of course is superficially
true, in so far that in the event of a riot or other
disturbance, with which the local police is for any
reason unable to cope, a sufficient number of troops
will be called out to assist the civil arm. But the
saying is not true if any suggestion of an offensive
alliance between constabulary and soldiery is intended;
nor is it true if it is meant to give the impression
that there is a potentiality of physical force behind
the policeman, which, under any circumstances whatever,
could be exerted to coerce the nation at large.</p>

<p>The members of the English police are public
servants in the fullest sense of the term; not servants
of any individual, of any particular class or sect, but
servants of the whole community&mdash;excepting only
that part of it which in setting the law at defiance, has
thereby become a public enemy. The strength of
the Man in Blue, properly understood, lies in the fact
that he has behind him the whole weight of public
opinion; for he only wages war against the law-breaker,
and in this contest can claim the goodwill
of every loyal citizen. If a police constable is in
need of assistance, he can call upon any bystander,
and in the King's name demand his active co-operation;
should the bystander refuse without being
able to prove physical impossibility or lawful excuse,
he can no longer be considered as a loyal citizen,
but is guilty of an indictable offence and becomes
liable to punishment.</p>

<p>The basis upon which our theory of police
ultimately rests, is the assumption that every lawful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>act performed by a police officer in the execution
of his duty, has the sanction and approval of the
great majority of his fellow-citizens; and under
our constitution it would be impossible for any
constabulary force to continue in existence, if its
actions persistently ran counter to the expressed
wishes of the people.</p>

<p>The actual continuance of the English police is
therefore dependent upon the consent of the people;
but this mere acquiescence is not enough. If the
police are to be efficient, they must earn for themselves
the respect and sympathy of all classes, they
must be popular. It is only on the rarest occasions
that a policeman is actually the eye-witness of a
crime, nor in the nature of things is he likely to be in
the confidence of the criminal. As a rule he must rely
on information, and generally speaking the public is
the only source from which the necessary knowledge
can be obtained. If the public are hostile, the one
source of information is closed, and the police are
rendered powerless. This difficulty has often been
experienced in Ireland, where, on several occasions,
it has proved a practical impossibility to discover
the authors of agrarian crime, even when all the
facts were well known to dozens of people, simply
because the whole neighbourhood had entered into a
conspiracy of silence. Such a man&oelig;uvre instantly
paralyzes the civil executive. In the olden days,
when an offence had been committed and there
was no culprit forthcoming, a fine was levied
against the hundred or hundreds implicated, and
justice was satisfied; in mediæval times, the "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">peine</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">forte et dure</span>" was employed to elicit information;
but since the abolition of torture no effectual method
has been invented by means of which an unwilling
witness can be forced to tell what he knows; in
Ireland, especially, the inducements held out by
Government, to tempt a man to speak, are of little
avail against the terrorism that the other side can
invoke by the mere whisper of the word "informer."</p>

<p>But there are other reasons, besides this important
question of obtaining information, why a measure of
popularity is of such extreme value to every police
force. There are a thousand ways in which the
members of an unpopular service can be embarrassed
and thwarted. No matter how capable and
painstaking a man may be, he cannot do himself
justice, nor can the best results attend his labours, if
his every act is questioned, and if at every turn he
has to surmount some obstacle set up to annoy and
discourage him. The constabulary has been described
as "The great army of order that is always
in the field"; the protracted campaign in which
this army is engaged is under all circumstances
extremely arduous, but it becomes doubly so when
its operations have to be conducted in an enemy's
country.</p>

<p>We demand intelligence, good personal character
and great physical strength from those to whom we
entrust the duties of peace maintenance; and if we
are to obtain men of the right stamp, men, that is, who
possess these qualifications, it is essential that the
police service should be held in popular esteem, and
that the position of a constable should be sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>well thought of, and sought after, to create a keen
competition for the vacancies as they occur. It
would never do to have to beat up recruits for the
constabulary forces, and to fall back on the expedients
that the military authorities have to resort
to to fill the ranks, nor to enlist immature lads in
the hope that some day they will grow into well-developed
men.</p>

<p>From every point of view, then, popularity is of
the utmost value to the police; and yet, from the
very nature of their duties it is extremely difficult
for them to win it. A policeman who will lend
himself to the screening of crime, or who is conveniently
blind on occasions, may quickly become
the object of a worthless and fleeting popularity; but
it is not the friendship of the publican nor the
applause of the rabble that is desirable; what is
wanted is the respect and approval of all good
citizens.</p>

<p>Year by year, in spite of occasional set-backs,
the English police have risen in the estimation of
their fellow-countrymen until they have won for
themselves a position in the minds of the people
which for respect and regard combined is without
a parallel in Europe. "Weak in numbers as
the force is," wrote Mr Munro, the late Commissioner
of Police for the Metropolis, "it would be
found in practice altogether inadequate were it not
strengthened, to an extent unknown, I believe, elsewhere,
by the relations that exist between the police
and public, and by the thorough recognition on the
part of the citizens at large of the police as their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>friends and protectors. The police touch all classes
of the public at many points beyond the performance
of their sterner duties as representatives of the law,
and they touch them in a friendly way.... The
police in short, are not the representatives of an
arbitrary and despotic power, directed against the
rights or obtrusively interfering with the pleasures of
law-abiding citizens: they are simply a disciplined
body of men, specially engaged in protecting 'masses'
as well as 'classes,' from any infringement of their
rights on the part of those who are not law-abiding."</p>

<p>The wisdom of fostering cordial relations between
the people and the civil defenders of their lives and properties
seems so obvious, that it is a source of wonder
that so little attention has been given to the study of
how best to promote this desirable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</i>.
Before the new police was instituted constables were
merely despised; after the re-organization was completed
they were generally feared and often hated;
the fact that they won their way to popularity is to
be attributed almost entirely to their own merits.
At the beginning of the century Colquhoun, who
was a long way in advance of his contemporaries in
his conceptions of what a police force should be,
wrote: "Everything that can heighten in any degree
the respectability of the office of constable, adds to
the security of the State, and to the safety of the life
and property of every individual," but at the time
only a very few people heeded what he said; and
parish authorities persisted in the idea that it did
not matter who or what a constable was so long as
he was cheap, whilst in more recent years, politicians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>of a certain stamp, who ought to be alive to the fatal
consequences of their action, have not scrupled to try
and stir up bad blood between the constabulary and
the uneducated section of the public, whenever it has
suited their purposes to do so, though happily without
much success.</p>

<p>If the co-operation of which we have been speaking
is to be complete, it should rest on a more
substantial basis than goodwill: it is not sufficient
that private citizens should be well-disposed towards
their allies, it is necessary also that they should be
acquainted with the conditions that govern the
mutual relationship. The sphere of police utility
is seriously limited by reason of the ignorance which
commonly prevails, both as to the executive powers
that private persons can assume as citizens, and
with respect to the functions that officials may
exercise by virtue of their office. In his "History
of the Criminal Law," Sir James Stephen thus
explains the position. "The police in their different
grades are no doubt officers appointed by law for
the purpose of arresting criminals, but they possess
for this purpose no powers that are not also possessed
by private persons.... A policeman has no other
right as to asking questions or compelling the attendance
of witnesses than a private person has; in a
word, with a few exceptions, he may be described as
a person paid to perform as a matter of duty acts,
which if he so minded, he might have done voluntarily."<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
The law on the subject is further defined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>by another authority in these words. "If a constable
be assaulted in the execution of his office, he need
not go back to the wall, as private persons ought to
do; and if, in the striving together, the constable
kill the assailant, it is no felony; but if the constable
be killed it shall be construed premeditated murder."<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
For all practical purposes, however, the only real
difference that exists between the powers that are
actively made use of by the police, and the latent
powers that are vested in every British citizen, is
this:&mdash;A police officer may arrest (without warrant)
if he has a reasonable suspicion that a felony has
taken place; a private person cannot arrest unless
he has certain knowledge that a felony has actually
been committed.</p>

<p>Within these limits, and according to our opportunities,
the duty of each one of us is clear and
inalienable, remaining the same to-day as it was in
the time of Queen Elizabeth, when it was written
"So that every English man is a sergeant to take
the thiefe, and who sheweth negligence therein do
not only incurre Evil opinion therefore, but hardly
shall escape punishment."<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>POLICE STATISTICS AND PENOLOGY</small></h2>


<p>Attention has already been directed to the
excessive zeal of the opponents of the "New
Police"; but no mention has been made of those
enthusiasts who looked for an instant millennium to
follow upon the adoption of the measures they
advocated. Yet there were many such who formed
extravagant hopes too high for realization. It is
seldom easy for the observer to arrive at a just
estimate of the value of a new institution until his
standpoint is far enough removed from the stress of
the moment to secure him from the current partisanship
which every novelty arouses. We, however,
who have crossed the threshold of the twentieth
century, can disregard the extreme views of both
parties, and heedless of the outpourings of admirers
and detractors alike, can gauge the issue by the light
of ascertained results, supported by facts and figures.
Judged by this standard, and viewed from the standpoint
of to-day, the police reforms inaugurated between
1829 and 1856 will be found to justify all reasonably
conceived expectations, disappointing as they no
doubt appeared to over-sanguine extremists at the
time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>
<p>Since the ideal standard of excellence aimed at
by every properly constituted police force is the
complete prevention of crime, and as there can be
no record of offences prevented, it is obviously
impossible to arrive at an entirely satisfactory conclusion
as to the efficiency of police by means of
any arithmetical process. At the same time it
will be allowed that if, whilst population increases,
recorded offences are a stationary, or better still if
they are a diminishing quantity, there is at least
strong presumptive evidence that the result is largely
due to the efficiency of the established police. Unfortunately
there is no infallible method of discovering
the amount of criminality existing in the country at
any given time; but, of all available statistics, the best
for our purpose are certainly those, which give the
annual total of commitments for indictable offences from
1834 until the present day. Before 1834 the records
are not altogether trustworthy; but the Parliamentary
Committee which sat in 1828, stated that in the ten
years between 1811 and 1821, during which the
average increase of population was about nineteen
per cent., the average increase of commitments for
the same period was no less than forty-eight per
cent. There can therefore be no doubt that prior
to the establishment of the new police the increase
of crime was outstripping the increase of population;
but taking only those figures which are generally
acknowledged to be correct, we get the following
interesting table.</p>

<p>Such is the remarkable result obtained by taking
the whole number of indictable offences sent for
trial at Assizes and Quarter Sessions in each Census-year
since 1834, nor is there any reason to suppose
that the process of amelioration has slackened to
any appreciable extent during the last decade.
When the Census returns for 1901 are published
it will probably be found that the population of
England and Wales now totals to about thirty-two
millions; and assuming that the amount of crime
committed during the current year is not abnormal,
the number of commitments will work out at a little
more than thirty for every hundred thousand inhabitants.
That is to say, during the last sixty
years, serious offences have decreased nearly sixty
per cent. in actual volume, and some eighty per cent.
if considered relatively to population&mdash;or in other
words, between two-thirds and five-sixths of the type
of crime, which sixty years ago brought men to trial,
is now prevented. These figures, of course, deal
with detected crime only: if it were possible to
include all grave offences, irrespective of whether
their authors were discovered or not, the results
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>would be even more striking, because owing to the
increased activity on the part of the police, and to
the greater readiness to prosecute on the part of the
public, comparatively few serious crimes now remain
mysteries for any length of time. Calculations based
on the number of offences disposed of by Courts of
Summary Jurisdiction are valueless if the object in
view is to estimate the prevalence of crime, because
not only are new minor offences continually being
created (thus rendering such returns too intricate for
purposes of ready comparison) but the inclusion of
trivial breaches of the Licensing Acts, Education
Acts, Vaccination Acts &amp;c. reduces the plane of
the enquiry from one which deals only with
crimes to one which is mainly concerned with
misdemeanours.</p>

<p>If we confine our attention, therefore, to the
Commitment Returns, the most noteworthy feature
which strikes us, is the drop between 1851 and
1861&mdash;the decade in which the Obligatory Act
gave the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-grâce</i> to the parochial system, and
for the first time covered the whole of England and
Wales with a network of stipendiary police. At
first sight it would appear that here was cause
and effect, that is, that the signal improvement
indicated by these statistics was primarily due
to the Act of 1856; it is more likely, however,
that the result must, in the main, be placed
to the credit of the police reforms of the
previous decade, for reasons which will presently
appear.</p>

<p>In view of these eminently satisfactory figures, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>may well be asked how it came about that those
persons, who most firmly believed that security was
only to be attained through police instrumentality,
were so grievously disappointed at the imaginary
failure of their pet scheme. In order to find the
answer to this question it will be necessary to probe
a little deeper into the statistics, and to do so by
the light of contemporary events. In the first place
it is to be remarked that a closer inspection of the
Commitment Returns reveals the fact that a reaction
took place between 1860 and 1863, the figures for
those years reading as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="commitmentreturns">
<tr><td class="tdl">1860</td>
    <td class="tdr">15,999</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">1861</td>
    <td class="tdr">18,326</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">1862</td>
    <td class="tdr">20,001</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">1863</td>
    <td class="tdr">20,818</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This result was due, no doubt, to the combined
effects of two distinct causes, one of which produced
an actual growth of crime, whilst the other accounted
for what was but an apparent increase of delinquency.
If it is true that crime was more common than
before, it is no less true that offences were more
commonly detected, the apparent increase being the
necessary result of the efficient action of the newly
organized Constabularies, which, naturally enough,
did not take full effect until the whole machine was
in proper working order. Before preventive police
can develop its maximum deterrent energy, it has to
prove its title to respect by its success in the detection
of crime; criminals do not search the Statutes
at Large, nor judge of the efficiency of a policeman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>from government statistics.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> They take him as they
find him, and learn to fear him only after they have
acquired a practical familiarity with his activity,
either by personal contact, or vicariously, through
the misfortunes of acquaintances. The significance
of the heavy Calendars in the early sixties, therefore,
is largely discounted by the fact, that the accumulations
of former years had to be dispersed, before
entire responsibility for the amount of crime prevailing
could be laid at the door of the new régime.
With regard to the second reason for the despondency
above referred to, it must be remembered
that offences against property so outnumber other
offences, that they entirely dominate all criminal
statistics; whilst the public alarm occasioned by a
single case of robbery involving personal injury to
an individual, is infinitely greater than that caused
by a whole series of depredations on property if
unaccompanied by violence. In the quinquennial
period (1857-1861), the number of persons for trial
at Assizes and Quarter Sessions, charged with
murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, felonious
wounding, malicious wounding and assault, amounted
to 1451; whilst in the next quinquennial period
(1862-1867), the number of commitments for these
offences had risen to 1712; and herein lay the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d'etre</i> for the widespread alarm which, in
1862 and 1863 especially, may be said to have
amounted to panic. Not only were such crimes
more frequent than had formerly been the case, but
they began to be marked by a degree of violence<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
which argued that a peculiarly desperate class of
criminal was abroad; and such indeed was the
actual state of affairs, occasioned by the temporary
breakdown of the penal system and consequent
upon the discontinuance of the practice of shipping
the most dangerous criminals across the seas.</p>

<p>Before the abolition of transportation, the career
of the criminal was generally brief unless he confined
his attention to petty depredations, or unless
he was particularly skilful in avoiding capture; a
felon once caught was given little chance of repeating
his offence. If he escaped the gallows he was
as a rule removed from the scene of his temptations,
never to return; and the labours of the police were
far less arduous as long as distant colonies were
content to absorb the dregs of our population, and
as long as the press-gang claimed a large proportion
of our vagabonds and neer-do-weels. Impressment,
however, practically ceased in 1835; and Australasia
soon grew weary of the refuse which we were
yearly depositing on her shores. Between 1840
and 1845 as many as seventeen thousand convicts
were sent to Van Diemen's Land alone, and in one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>year more than four thousand felons were transported
to Australia: the result was that the supply
exceeded the demand, and the colonists, though not
blind to the advantages of a moderate supply of
free labour, began to protest warmly against the
wholesale importation of such eminently undesirable
neighbours. A large public meeting was held at
Sydney in 1850, at which it was unanimously
decided to petition Her Majesty to procure the
immediate discontinuance of transportation; the
British Government at once consented, and after
1852 no more convicts were sent to New South
Wales, Tasmania, or South Australia.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Morally
bound, as it was, to comply with the request of the
Colonists, the government found itself impaled on
the horns of a dilemma: about nine thousand
persons actually under sentence of transportation
lay awaiting disposal in the Hulks, and the number
was steadily increasing. It was impossible to set
them at liberty; there was no room in the English
prisons; and there was nowhere to send them to
except Western Australia, which, though still willing
to annually receive a certain proportion, was unable
to digest such an accumulation. The demoralization
which infected the ordinary gaols was
as nothing compared to that which pervaded the
Hulks,&mdash;filthy derelict vessels crowded with unclean
and abandoned mortals who were allowed absolutely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>free intercourse with each other, and who were subjected
to no supervision beyond that exercised by a
sentry or two with loaded muskets.</p>

<p>In this emergency extra prison accommodation was
hurriedly provided. Portsmouth prison was opened
in 1852; Dartmoor (originally designed for the
detention of French prisoners-of-war, but long disused)
was converted into a convict establishment in
1855, and a new prison at Chatham was made
ready in the year following. In this way the
immediate necessity was partially relieved; but for
the complete solution of the difficulty, a radical
reform of the whole penal system had to be devised.
Convicts who had been sentenced to transportation
could not in common fairness be detained in English
prisons for the whole period of their sentences, and
there was no law which authorized any remission.
Prisoners felt that they had a grievance, and mutinous
outbreaks occurred at Dartmoor, Portland and
Chatham.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Under these circumstances a "Penal
Servitude Act"<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> was introduced, which provided
that henceforward penal servitude was to be substituted
for transportation as the punishment for all
offences too serious to be met by simple imprisonment,
yet not of sufficient enormity to deserve a
sentence of fourteen years; at the same time it was
notified that those persons, then in confinement, who
had been condemned to transportation were to be
released with a free pardon after the expiration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>from half to two-thirds of their original sentence.
In 1857 another act was passed, authorizing the
Secretary of State conditionally to discharge convicts
undergoing penal servitude in England, before
they had served their full term. This system,
popularly known as the Ticket-of-leave system,
was sound in theory, and whenever properly administered
has proved both beneficial to prisoners
and harmless to society. But when first inaugurated
it produced the most disastrous consequences.
Under present conditions a convict can only earn
remission by good behaviour and constant industry,
generally leaving the prison a better man than when
he entered it, even if he is not entirely reformed;
whilst under the old conditions, incarceration corrupted
the novice in crime, and still further hardened
the habitual offender. The last hulk was closed in
1857, and a few years afterwards the effect of the
unavoidable policy of turning loose unreformed gaol-birds
was fully experienced, and the sequel made
apparent in the criminal statistics of the period.</p>

<p>According to the intention of its authors, adequate
police supervision over those who had been
conditionally liberated on license was an essential
feature of the Ticket-of leave system, but this was
not the interpretation adopted by the Home Office,
for on behalf of that Department, evidence was given
before the Select Committee of 1856 to the effect
that "it was thought far better to give no directions
whatever to the police on the subject, but to leave
them (<i>i.e.</i> the license-holders) precisely in the situation
of men who had served out the whole period of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>their sentence." On every ticket-of-leave issued,
the following conditions were endorsed:&mdash;"Notice&mdash;(1)&mdash;The
power of revoking or altering the license of
a convict will most certainly be exercised in case of
his misconduct. (2)&mdash;If, therefore, he wishes to retain
the privilege, which by his good behaviour
under penal discipline he has obtained, he must
prove by his subsequent conduct that he is really
worthy of Her Majesty's clemency. (3)&mdash;To produce
a forfeiture of the license, it is by no means
necessary that the holder should be convicted of any
new offence. If he associates with notoriously bad
characters, leads an idle or dissolute life, or has no
visible means of obtaining an honest livelihood, &amp;c.&mdash;it
will be assumed that he is about to relapse into
crime, and he will be at once apprehended, and recommitted
to prison under his original sentence."</p>

<p>These conditions, admirable in themselves, were
not enforced and so were practically useless. Ticket-of-leave
men almost invariably destroyed their
licenses (which they were not compelled to keep),
and if apprehended for a fresh offence, or on suspicion,
stoutly denied that they had previously been convicted;
nor was it easy for the authorities to prove
the contrary in the absence of any proper system
for the registration of convicts. The helplessness of
the police in the matter may be measured by the
fact that constables were instructed on no account to
interfere with ticket-of-leave men, "nor when seen in
public houses are they to be pointed out to the
landlord, and required to leave, as in other cases of
convicted thieves and suspected characters." It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>of course only just that convicts released on license
should not have their comings and goings continually
dogged by constables; but to elevate them into a
privileged class, and to place them on a higher plane
than "suspected characters" who had never been
convicted, was, in the words of Sir Richard Mayne,
"to give them opportunities to commit crime which
they might not otherwise have." The police were
not to blame for this state of things, for they only
carried out the instructions of the Home Office,
which, again, did not feel justified in interfering with
liberated convicts unless authorized to do so by Act
of Parliament. To shew how entirely the police
authorities dissociated themselves from any responsibility
for the supervision of licensees, it may be
mentioned that, in his evidence before the Select
Committee of 1856, the Chief Commissioner of
Police for the Metropolis made the following confession.
"It may appear strange for me to say so,
but until a few months ago I never saw a ticket-of-leave,
and did not know what was endorsed upon it:&mdash;it
was no business of mine."<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>Fortunately this state of affairs was not allowed
to continue indefinitely. Various reforms, extending
over a series of years, were successively taken in
hand with the object of making penal servitude
reformatory as well as retributive, of ensuring that
convicts released on ticket-of-leave should remain
under police supervision until the expiration of their
sentences, of arresting the criminal career of juvenile
law-breakers by means of reformatories and industrial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>schools; and of protecting society, as far as possible,
from the repeated ravages of incorrigible offenders,
by instituting a system for the thorough identification
and registration of criminals. The history of
these reforms must be briefly sketched.</p>

<p>Of all the abuses which used to disgrace our penal
establishments, the most disastrous in its results, was
the promiscuous herding together of male with
female, adult with juvenile, habitual with casual
offenders, under conditions calculated to lower the
tone of the whole prison community to the level of
the most degraded inmate. The evils inseparable
from unchecked association of felons in confinement
were recognised even in the eighteenth century; and
Bentham, Howard, and other reformers persistently
urged the adoption of the "separate" system for all
English prisons. Ultimately the Government was
induced to make the experiment, and in 1821
Millbank Penitentiary was opened for the reception
of prisoners. A long delay followed, and not until
1840 was the first stone of the next model prison
laid at Pentonville. Both Millbank and Pentonville
were constructed on the "radiating" principle which
admits of the constant exercise of perfect supervision
over all the prisoners, who are, however, confined in
separate compartments. The expense of the new
establishments, as well as a popular prejudice against
solitary confinement due to its too rigorous enforcement
in Pennsylvania, retarded progress, and although
a few gaols of a modern type were here and there
constructed, the large majority of those convicts who
were not transported, were allowed to corrupt each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>other in the old-fashioned local prisons. This policy
of inaction continued until 1865, when the "Prison
Act" was passed, which requires that every male
prisoner shall be accommodated with a separate cell,
and which insists on uniformity of treatment for
all persons (except first-class misdemeanants and
debtors) undergoing a sentence of two years'
imprisonment or less.</p>

<p>We have already seen how the gradual discontinuance
of transportation (1838-1867) and the abolition
of the hulks (1857) caused "Public Works Prisons"
to be established at Dartmoor, Chatham, etc. At
these places, (where prisoners undergoing penal
servitude are incarcerated) the plan of silent associated
labour by day, with separate confinement by
night, was adopted; and although no relaxation of
discipline was allowed, the reform of the criminal,
rather than his punishment, was aimed at. Under
the modern system the convict spends the first nine
months of his penal servitude at Pentonville, or in
some other local prison, and during this period is
kept to solitary hard labour of an irksome and unproductive
description; he is then moved to one or
other of the "Public Works Prisons," where his life
at once becomes less monotonous. As long as his
conduct merits advancement, he is passed through
various stages, each more tolerable than the last;
most of his work is now done in the open air and in
the company of his fellows; and hope lightens his
labour, for by constant industry and by an exact
observance of the prison rules, he is allowed to earn
a partial remission of his sentence, amounting to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>about a quarter<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> of the whole term. Our penal
system may not yet be perfect; but during the late
reign prison life underwent a marvellous metamorphosis.
Pest-houses have been transformed into
sanatoriums where the patients have to submit to a
healthy discipline beneficial to the mind as well as
to the body; formerly gaol-fever, dirt, and bad food
ruined the constitution, whilst evil communications
corrupted the mind; now convicts leave their prison
physically robust and often morally convalescent.
This amelioration of the conditions to which prisoners
are subjected has been accompanied, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</i>, by a
steady decrease in the number of convicts in confinement.
When Queen Victoria came to the throne,
43,000<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> of her subjects were convicts, at the present
time they number less than 6000,<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> and this in spite
of the fact that during the interval the population of
these islands has just about doubled itself.</p>

<p>Whilst the reform of the adult and hardened convict
is of very high import, the welfare of society is
even more profoundly influenced by the result of its
efforts directed towards the prevention of crime in
the first instance; and the value of prevention (which
by common consent is at all times higher than that
of the best possible cure) may be said to bear an
inverse ratio to the age of the individuals who are
saved from committing themselves to a career of
crime. The surest method of permanently reducing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>the number of criminals lies in the comprehensive
employment of agencies especially devoted to the
prevention of juvenile delinquency. Anti-social
habits formed in childhood are in after years only
eradicated with the greatest difficulty, the criminal
child too often being the father of the criminal man.
During the latter half of the eighteenth, and early in
the nineteenth century, the manufacture of juvenile
criminals went on apace. Bow Street Runners on the
look-out for blood-money were careful not to interfere
with a promising youngster until he had actually
committed a felony; parish constables would not
trouble to pursue a culprit upon whose conviction
only half expenses were allowed; and the reluctance
of the general public to prosecute was especially pronounced
when the offender was of tender years.
Meanwhile scoundrels of the Fagin type, trading on the
impunity enjoyed by child-thieves, grew rich on the
plunder collected by their pupils, who, sooner or later,
received the finishing touches to their criminal education
in the public gaols at the public expense. The
extent of the evils which resulted are incalculable;
but competent experts were of opinion that nearly
sixty per cent. of habitual offenders had been initiated
into their dishonest career before they were fifteen
years of age.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>Private philanthropy interested itself on behalf of
the children long before the Government made any
move in the matter. In the eighteenth century a
Marine Society for sending lads to sea, and an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>agricultural school for teaching farming, had been
formed at Portsmouth and Redhill respectively, with
the object of befriending boys who otherwise were
in danger of lapsing into crime; but for many years
these were the only agencies of the sort. The
Ragged School movement, so warmly espoused by
Lord Shaftesbury, took practical shape soon after
the Queen's accession, in schools in Westminster,
at Old Pye Street, and at Field Lane. The first
industrial feeding-school was opened at Aberdeen
in 1841; and it proved so successful that the idea
was taken up throughout Scotland. Before long
Manchester and other English towns followed the
example set by the granite city. Excellent as
were many of the schools established by private
benevolence, they all laboured under two very formidable
disadvantages:&mdash;they could not compel
unwilling parents to send their children to be
reformed, or to contribute anything towards their
maintenance, and they could not legally detain
their pupils any longer than they cared to stay.</p>

<p>The first public institution for the detention of
juvenile criminals was opened at Parkhurst in 1838.
Though called a reformatory, it was in effect a gaol,
and hardly differed at all from other prisons except
with regard to the age of its inmates. The exertions
of Lord Shaftesbury and of Mr Adderley (Lord
Norton) who strove to convince the nation of the
fatal consequences of its apathy, were soon to be
rewarded. A Select Committee of the House of
Lords which sat in 1847, was followed by the
Juvenile Offenders Act of the same year; in 1851
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>and following years conferences, largely attended by
people interested in the reformatory question, were
held at Birmingham, with the object of discovering
some better method of dealing with youthful criminals
than that in vogue, and the whole subject was
investigated at some length by Parliamentary Committees
appointed in 1853 and 1854. The result
of these deliberations took shape in the latter year
when the "Reformatory School Act"<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> was passed,
giving magistrates the option of committing offenders
under sixteen years of age to reformatories, for a
term not exceeding five years, in lieu of sentencing
them to imprisonment, penal servitude, or transportation.
The expense of the new reformatories
was met, partly by Treasury contributions, partly
by grants from the local authorities, and partly by
compulsory subscriptions of not more than five
shillings a week exacted from the parents or
guardians of the offending children. The Act of
1854 was amended and improved by subsequent
Acts passed in 1855 and 1856, but these early
enactments<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> were open to the objection that they
only applied to juveniles who had already been
convicted of a serious offence, and left untouched
a large class of children which, for one cause or
another, always stands on the brink of criminality;&mdash;for
no juvenile was eligible for admission into a
reformatory unless he had previously been committed
to prison for fourteen days.</p>

<p>This omission was repaired by the "Certified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>Industrial School Act" passed in 1857,<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and
amended in 1861,<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> which provided that certain
young persons, who had not been in gaol, might
be sent to industrial schools under a magistrate's
warrant, to be detained therein until they should
attain the age of sixteen. The class of children
to whom this Act applied were described as follows:&mdash;"Any
child apparently under the age of fourteen
years, found begging or receiving alms ... any
child ... found wandering, and not having any
home or settled place of abode, or any visible
means of subsistence ... or being an orphan, or
whose only surviving parent is in prison ... or
who frequents the company of reputed thieves ...
or whose mother has twice been convicted of crime ... or
whose parents represent that they are
unable to control him, ... or any child apparently
under the age of twelve years who, having committed
an offence punishable by imprisonment or
some less punishment, ought nevertheless, in the
opinion of the Justices, regard being had to his
age, and to the circumstances of the case, to be
sent to an Industrial School, &amp;c."</p>

<p>In 1854 only twenty-nine children were sent to
reformatories. Since that date, the numbers so committed
gradually increased until 1881, in which
year the maximum (6738) was reached. The
decrease which has recently taken place may be
chiefly attributed to the fact that magistrates now
generally prefer the industrial to the reformatory
school whenever possible, a method of dealing with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>youthful offenders the wisdom of which has been
vindicated by an accompanying diminution in the
tale of juvenile crime.</p>

<p>The essential differences between Reformatories
and Industrial Schools are, that no stigma attaches
to any boy on account of his having been educated
at the latter, and that whilst the discipline enforced
at the former institutions is sufficiently severe for
them to be considered as places of punishment,
Industrial Schools are intended only to take the
place of that parental control and training which
the child cannot obtain at home. The principle
of giving another chance to unfortunates who are
rather sinned against than sinning lies at the root
of the Industrial School movement; and there is
no development of preventive police more in sympathy
with the wisdom of the age than this. In
recent years the same principle has, with excellent
effect, been extended to embrace adult as well as
juvenile offenders. The Summary Jurisdiction Act
of 1879<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> (<i>i.e.</i> so much of it as permits the infliction
of a fine instead of imprisonment) and the Probation
of First Offenders Act of 1887,<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> are both, it may be
noted, conceived in the same wise and merciful spirit.
The latter measure especially, which was introduced
by Sir Howard Vincent, has been instrumental in
reclaiming to an honest life hundreds of prisoners
"guilty of a first offence not the product of a
criminal mind."<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The latest Home Office returns
go to prove that, in the large majority of instances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>in which this humane policy has been applied, confidence
has not been misplaced; for of the whole
number of first offenders conditionally released upon
recognizances,<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> to come up for judgment when called
upon, only about ten per cent. have shown themselves
unworthy of the leniency extended to them
by relapsing into crime.</p>

<p>The tendency of recent penal legislation has been
to discriminate as closely as possible between the
casual and the habitual offender, reducing to the
lowest limit, consistent with safety, the penalties exacted
against the former, whilst placing every legitimate
obstruction in the path of the latter, by making
his punishments cumulative as long as he continues
to offend, and by maintaining a vigilant supervision
over his conduct whilst he is at large. This is one
of the most important duties that modern police
have to perform, and it is one which demands great
tact combined with persistence from individual
peace officers, as well as complete co-operation
between all the allied police organizations throughout
the country. Under the parochial system both
these necessary qualifications were conspicuously
absent, and if transportation had suddenly come
to an end before the police reforms described in
previous chapters had been taken in hand, the unchecked
excesses of habitual criminals might have
endangered the very foundations of English society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be remembered that when the ticket-of-leave
system was first introduced, considerable alarm
was occasioned on account of the increase of crime;
which, not altogether without reason, was generally
attributed to the license-holders, who, unreformed by
penal discipline, and consequently unfitted for unqualified
liberty, were suddenly released in large
numbers, without any adequate precautions being
taken to control them. We have seen how the
reorganization of the entire prison system gradually
eliminated the causes which tended to make the
ex-prisoner even more dangerous to society on the
day of his discharge than he had been before conviction,
and we have seen how by the introduction
of an improved plan of giving marks for industry
(which, however, were subject to forfeiture for ill-conduct),
only those convicts were released before
the expiration of their full sentence who had earned
partial remission by virtue of consistent good behaviour.
We now come to a consideration of the
measures subsequently adopted for the proper supervision
of these ticket-of-leave men.</p>

<p>The conditions endorsed on every license have
already been given, but as the police were expressly
ordered to take no notice of liberated
convicts, unless they were actually engaged in
criminal pursuits, but little practical value attached
to the wording of the ticket. In 1864 some important
changes were introduced by the 4th Section
of the Penal Servitude Act of that year, which
requires that:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>I.&mdash;The holder shall preserve his license, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>produce it when called upon to do so by a Magistrate
or police officer.</li>

<li>II.&mdash;He shall abstain from any violation of the
law.</li>

<li>III.&mdash;He shall not habitually associate with
notoriously bad characters, such as reputed thieves
and prostitutes.</li>

<li>IV.&mdash;He shall not lead an idle and dissolute life,
nor be without visible means of obtaining an honest
livelihood.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The penalties for the non-observance of these
requirements were as follows&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Any ticket-of-leave
man, convicted of an indictable offence, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso-facto</i>
forfeited his license, and this in addition to
any punishment to which he might be sentenced
upon indictment; (<i>b</i>) Any ticket-of-leave man proved
to have transgressed the conditions of his license by
an act not of itself punishable either upon indictment
or upon summary conviction, nevertheless rendered
himself liable to be summarily punished by imprisonment
not exceeding three months. In 1871
the "Prevention of Crimes Act,"<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> amending "The
Habitual Criminals Act" of 1869, extended the
principle of keeping notoriously bad characters under
observation, by enacting that persons twice convicted
of certain crimes may be subjected to police supervision
for not more than seven years after the expiration
of the sentence imposed, provided that a previous
conviction for an offence in the same category is
proved at the time of the second conviction. Such
persons are commonly called 'supervisees,' and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>come under the same conditions as license-holders.
These conditions have since been modified by Acts
of Parliament passed in 1869 and 1891, and they
may now be summarized as follows. Both ticket-of-leave
men and supervisees are required to report
themselves within forty-eight hours after their arrival
in any police district to the Chief-Officer of Police
in that district, to report themselves once a month
afterwards,<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and to notify any change of address to
the same authority; they are also expected to satisfy
the police that they are earning their living by honest
means.</p>

<p>A constable is justified in arresting without warrant
any license-holder or supervisee whom he reasonably
suspects of having committed an offence, or of having
failed to comply with the above-mentioned conditions;
and if it be found, after investigation by a
competent magistrate, that such an offence has been
committed or default made, the license-holder thereupon
becomes liable to the forfeiture of his license,
and the supervisee to imprisonment with or without
hard labour for a period not exceeding one year,
unless he can prove to the satisfaction of the proper
authority "that being on a journey he tarried no
longer ... than was reasonably necessary, or that he
did his best to act in conformity with the law."<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>In order that police supervision may be safe
and effectual, it is of course necessary that the identification
of habitual criminals should be certain and
the registration of convicts complete. The present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>system would have been fraught with the gravest
dangers to public liberty had it been attempted at
the time when there was no possibility of any more
reliable record than that founded upon the memories
of policemen and prison-warders; but since the introduction
of photography, and especially since the
recent adoption of the system of anthropometry
which is associated with the names of M. Alphonse
Bertillon and Mr Francis Galton, the chance of any
miscarriage of justice, due to mistakes in identification,
has been reduced to a minimum. Photography
was first adapted to police purposes in 1854, when
the governor of Bristol Gaol began to make daguerreotype
pictures of the prisoners who passed through
his hands; and gradually what was at first but the
experimental hobby of an amateur developed into
the officially recognised system. The "Prevention
of Crimes" Act (1871) had directed that registers of
all persons convicted of crime in England should be
kept at Scotland Yard, but it was soon found by
experience that a less voluminous record would be
of greater practical value. Accordingly it was
decided in 1877 that, in future, the registers (the
compilation of which was at this time transferred
from Scotland Yard to the Home Office) should
contain only the descriptions of habitual criminals,
officially so called. In 1880 a new department was
opened at the Head-Quarters of the Metropolitan
Police, called the Convict Supervision Office, which
was largely occupied with the classification of offenders
by means of books containing the photographs
of habituals. These albums, together with a register
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>of distinctive marks, including a record of tattooed
symbols and initials so universal amongst criminals,
formed a regular rogues' gallery, and were instrumental
in proving the identity of many inveterate delinquents
who might otherwise have improperly participated in
the leniency intended only for first offenders.</p>

<p>Some of the more energetic police forces in the provinces,
also, prepared local registers; and something
like a general scheme for tracing the antecedents of
criminals was evolved by means of circular "Route
Forms" (as descriptions of offenders whose identity
was uncertain were technically called) which were
forwarded in rotation from one police district to
another, wherever the required information was
likely to be forthcoming. The results obtained,
however, hardly justified the expenditure of time
and energy incurred in the process; accordingly in
1893 a Parliamentary Committee was appointed "to
enquire into the best means available for identifying
habitual criminals," and it was on the recommendation
of this expert committee that the perfect anthropometric
system of identification now employed was based.</p>

<p>Very briefly stated, the system is as follows.
All persons convicted of crime against whom a
previous criminal conviction has been proved, or
who are subject to police supervision, are carefully
measured before they are liberated, and the results
tabulated on what are called card-registers. The
parts of the body selected for measurement are those
which in an adult are the least liable to alteration;
the length and breadth of the head, and the length
of the foot, for instance, being reliable indicia by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>means of which thousands of individuals may readily
be classified.</p>

<p>Whilst M. Bertillon's system of anthropometry is
especially well adapted for purposes of classification,
Mr Galton's finger-print method is preferable for
purposes of identification. The minute lines which
may be noticed on the skin covering the under side
of the top joint of the human finger or thumb
invariably display a well defined series of curved
ridges, which, though never quite alike in different
subjects, always approximate to one of four types,
that is to say, they assume the form of an arch, a
whorl, a right loop, or a left loop. The sum of the
combinations which can be formed of these types
and their modifications on the ten digits being a
practically inexhaustible quantity, every human being
carries on his finger-tips an infallible record of his
personal identity. Accordingly the criminal is
required to make signature by pressing with his
thumb, fore, and middle fingers of both hands
(previously smeared with printer's ink) on the
reverse side of the card-register; whilst to make
assurance trebly sure, the exact location and measurement
of any distinctive marks that may be found
are noted, and his photograph, both full-face and in
profile, is added. When completed, the card-registers
are filed in cabinets on an ingenious plan which
enables the searcher to lay his hand on any particular
"dossier" in the space of a very few minutes.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>The immense importance of having a comprehensive
and accessible record of this nature can
hardly be over-rated, for without its help it would
be impossible to combat (with any chance of success)
what is unquestionably the most dangerous
development of contemporary criminality. It has
recently been pointed out by Dr Anderson, of the
Criminal Investigation Department, that despite the
marked decrease of crime which we congratulate
ourselves has been one of the most noteworthy
features of the Victorian era, "the professional
criminal is developing and becoming a serious
public danger."<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Since the abolition of transportation
the company of criminals who are criminal by
deliberate choice has been steadily increasing, and
every mitigation of the penal code, every alleviation
of prison existence, has helped to bring recruits to
the profession. Frequent sentences of imprisonment
will never deter the delinquent who is well
acquainted with the inside of a gaol, as long as he
can count on brief spells of exciting and luxurious
liberty between whiles; moreover the tax on the
police is excessive, for the habitual criminal may
be trapped again and again, only to be released
time after time to devise new and more elaborate
attacks on a long-suffering society.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>A way will have to be discovered to eliminate
this unexpected product of our penal system, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>to this end various suggestions have been made.
Some advocate life sentences for persistent offenders;
others would make the restitution of the plunder,
or at any rate a confession implicating the receiver
of the stolen property, the only condition of release
in cases of theft; but although authorities differ as to
the exact course which ought to be pursued, all
agree that the character of the criminal rather than
the enormity of his offence should chiefly determine
the question of the punishment administered.
Whatever may be the nature of the plan of campaign
eventually decided upon for the suppression
of professional delinquency, the preliminary stage of
the operations is necessarily the same, and consists
in the preparation of a record containing
an accurate and concise account of the antecedents
and previous convictions of all habitual
criminals.</p>

<p>There was a time when "abjuration of the realm"
was considered a complete expiation for crime however
heinous; but as the outer world became more
civilised, and foreign parts more accessible, voluntary
expatriation ceased to be the recognised alternative
to punishment. The first result of the introduction
of railways in this country (as far as the relation
of crime to police is concerned) was to benefit the
fraternity of thieves whose trade is essentially one
that thrives best under nomadic conditions; subsequently,
with the development of modern conveniences
for travel, the police were again placed
at a disadvantage, this time by the facility with
which criminals, who are generally able to obtain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>at least a few hours' start, could find a safe refuge
from their pursuers in some haven oversea&mdash;the
modern equivalent for the mediæval sanctuary.
There has ever been, and always will be, a ding-dong
contest between the lawbreaker and the
policeman, wherein the fortunes of the day favour
first one side and then the other; for if the advantage
that attaches to the opening gambit belongs to the
criminal, his adversary is soon ready with an answer.
The telegraph<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> beats the steamship, and the international
system of police which now mutually provides
for the surrender of fugitive offenders has
restored the balance. The first extradition treaty
in which Great Britain was interested was concluded
with the United States of America in 1842, and the
Extradition Acts of 1870 and 1873 now regulate
the conduct of the English Government in its dealings
with foreign powers in all that concerns this
important department of police.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>In 1879, a reform long agitated for was inaugurated
by the tardy appointment of a Public
Prosecutor, who became responsible that the cause
of justice is not injured through the non-prosecution
of persons guilty of serious offences. The intervention
of the Director of Public Prosecutions is seldom
deemed necessary, but circumstances occasionally
arise in which lack of funds, local sympathy with
the criminal, or an attempt to compound a felony,
may demand his active interference.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> The "Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>secution

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>DETECTIVE POLICE AND THE RIGHT OF PUBLIC
MEETING</small></h2>


<p>It is popularly believed that the least efficient
department of English police is that which is
concerned with the detection of crime, and our
detective service is often compared with corresponding
agencies abroad in order to point the moral
that we should do well to imitate the methods of
our neighbours. It is certainly true that our
detectives are proportionally less numerous than
their continental confrères, true also, that extraordinary
facilities for successful police action such
as are granted in foreign countries are here denied;
but the familiar accusation that we maintain a
clumsy gang of amateurs who are deficient in the
finesse necessary to cope with the skilful forger or
the accomplished cracksman, is either spitefully or
ignorantly advanced. The self-constituted censors
who are so ready to lament the alleged incompetence
of our detectives would be the foremost to
complain should a measure of State protection,
equal to that enjoyed by foreign police functionaries,
be conferred on any such agent at home.
The traditional love of liberty which, in this country,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>has always opposed espionage with so much resolution,
is altogether admirable; but like everything
else that is precious, it has to be purchased at a
price, and in this case the price is the dangerous
latitude conceded to "the powers that prey."</p>

<p>Before attempting to estimate the efficiency of
the detective service, two considerations in particular
ought to be weighed. One is that any
institution which perforce must shun recognition
and advertisement is little likely to be appraised
at its true worth by the public. The other is that
whilst the wealth of London attracts the best
criminal talent of both hemispheres, its expanse
renders the detection and pursuit of crime more
than ordinarily difficult. In spite of this, and
in spite also of the limitations imposed by national
sentiment, the success achieved by the sleuth-hounds
of the English police need not fear comparison,
if fairly made, with that attained by any
who are engaged in the same work elsewhere: it
may be that tenacity of purpose and honesty of
motive go a long way to compensate for any genius
for artifice or power of disguise that the English
detective lacks.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, however, that honesty has
not invariably distinguished our thief-takers. The
Bow Street Runners were often arrant humbugs
besides being self-seeking knaves, nor were their
successors always free from reproach. The small
detective force established in 1842 was at first
exclusively recruited from the uniform branch of
the police, and generally speaking the custom then
introduced has since been adhered to; for although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>theoretically any suitable person is eligible for
employment as a detective, the few outsiders who
have been given a trial have almost without exception
proved failures. It cannot be held that the
ordinary point and beat duty is the best possible
training for a career which demands an exceptional
astuteness of intellect, nor that the routine discipline
of a constabulary force is calculated to develop the
reasoning faculties to any great extent. But
although the system which finds favour to-day is
in all probability far from being the best that could
be devised, it has nevertheless much to commend
it; the responsibilities that belong to the detective,
and the temptations which surround him, are so
exceptional that it would be extremely dangerous
to entrust an unknown man with the former or to
expose an untried man to the latter. A second
reason why the existing method of selection is
desirable is because anything that tends to promote
a good understanding and complete co-operation
between the uniform and the plain-clothes
branches of the police makes for efficiency.</p>

<p>The perils to which society is exposed when
clever criminals and dishonest police officers conspire
together had been forcibly exemplified when
the celebrated bank-frauds came to light early in
the nineteenth century. But the point of elaboration
to which so obvious a criminal man&oelig;uvre could be
carried was not fully realised until 1877, when the
details of what is commonly called the De Goncourt
case were published to the world. Harry Benson
and his confederate Kurr were a brace of criminals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>with a real genius for high-class swindling, such as,
fortunately for gullible human nature, is rarely met
with. After netting immense sums of money by
means of bogus betting agencies and other nefarious
schemes, Benson conceived the idea of insuring his
ill-gotten gains by approaching the very police-officers
(Meiklejohn and Druscovitch) who were
charged with the duty of tracking him down, and
of corrupting them with subsidies until they became
his creatures and confederates. Once the proffered
premium had been accepted, there was no limit to the
audacity of the subsequent proceedings. Telegrams
from Paris addressed to Scotland Yard were intercepted
and handed to Benson, who was forewarned
by his pursuers of every move intended against
him. When the partners were eventually arrested
in Holland, a forged telegram, purporting to come
from the English headquarters of police, was addressed
to the Dutch authorities ordering the release
of the prisoners; but the artifice failed and the culprits
were escorted home, in the custody, strangely
enough, of Druscovitch, whose dishonesty was still
unsuspected. Convicted and committed to Millbank,
Benson at once proceeded to "give away" the policemen
he had suborned, with the result that four inspectors
were arraigned on charges of conspiring to
defeat the ends of justice, and of complicity with the
frauds of their late employer: three out of the four
were found guilty and sentenced to various terms of
imprisonment, but the matter was not allowed to
end there. In order to guard against any recurrence
of such a scandalous breach of trust, the organization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>of the whole detective department was overhauled, and
its administration placed in other hands. The task of
reorganization was entrusted to Mr Howard Vincent,<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
who devoted his energies towards raising the tone
of the then discredited detective service. In 1878
what was practically a new department was formed
at Scotland Yard under the title of "The Criminal
Investigation Department," consisting of a chief
superintendent and about thirty superior officers at
headquarters, besides a local inspector assisted by
from six to fifteen detectives in each of the town
divisions&mdash;the whole under the control of the
Director of Criminal Investigations,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> who takes
charge of all the criminal business of the Metropolis,
and whose assistance, sometimes indispensable,
is often solicited by the chiefs of rural and urban
constabularies throughout the country.</p>

<p>The numerical strength of the detective force has
been considerably augmented since its reorganization
in 1878 (in 1895 it consisted of 472 officers), and
its rôle increasingly tends to grow in importance.
In 1880 the newly established Convict Supervision
Office was brought into close association with the
Criminal Investigation Department, and the constant
vigilance that has to be maintained over
foreign anarchists domiciled in England, as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>the necessity for frequent correspondence with the
American and Continental police, preliminary to the
extraditing of fugitive offenders, causes the department
to wear the aspect of an international bureau
for the unravelment of crime. The detective branch
of the City of London police, on the other hand,
makes a speciality of the investigation of commercial
frauds, a vast field of possible enterprise,
not the less extensive for the fact that the area
policed by the City force is but a single square
mile.</p>

<p>It would have been worse than useless to have
increased the detective staff unless at the same time
care had been taken to safeguard the public from the
risk of a repetition of abuses similar to those revealed
in the course of the de Goncourt case, and this made
the problem of reform a difficult one. It is impossible
to devise a method of selection by means of
which every black sheep who may seek admission is
infallibly recognised and excluded, nor is it easy
adequately to supervise confidential agents without
interfering with their work; but it may safely be
said that since the reorganization of the department,
a high standard of honesty has been found to be not
incompatible with professional zeal and proficiency.
No policeman who is thorough in his work can please
all parties, and some thirteen or fourteen years ago a
series of ill-natured attacks were directed against
both branches of the Metropolitan Police. Constables
and detectives were accused of exceeding
their authority and of levying black-mail, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>allegations, which were somewhat recklessly supported
by prominent illwishers and busybodies, could
not be substantiated when the charges came to be
investigated by the proper authority.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>The intense hostility with which Peel's reforms
were at first greeted, besides being the cause of much
inconvenience at the time, was also the parent of
many posthumous difficulties, that continued to embarrass
the police authorities long after the original
quarrel was dead and buried. It will be remembered
that the two main contentions, often repeated by the
hostile party in 1829 and after, were to the effect
that the liberty of the subject was in grave danger
at the hands of an unconstitutional "gendarmerie,"
armed with mysterious powers of domiciliary espionage,
and that the expense to the ratepayers of maintaining
these tyrants would be ruinous. Rather than
give a handle to his adversaries, who were sure to
acclaim every plain-clothes policeman as a Government
spy intriguing against innocent citizens, the
author of modern police was forced to dispense with
the invaluable assistance of a detective staff; and in
order to disprove the forecasts of opponents who
prophesied financial disaster, he was compelled to
fix the constable's wage at a very low figure.
Enough has been said as to the manner in which
the original lack of a detective department has
gradually been remedied, and although space does
not admit of anything like a full account being given
of the various phases through which the financial
problem has passed, a subject so vital to the well-being
of police cannot be altogether ignored.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>
<p>Police expenditure is of two kinds: there is the
weekly wage-bill, and there are the working (including
administrative) expenses. Under the old system,
although little was spent in actual pay, large sums
were scandalously muddled away in rewards, fees
and allowances; when the new constabularies superseded
the old parochial bodies, much public money
had to be sunk in the acquisition of sites, and in the
erection of suitable station-houses, cells and offices;
and the upkeep of these establishments, as well as
the incidental working expenses connected with
them, were on a generous scale. As, therefore, only
a very limited income was available for the whole
service, and as interest had to be paid on the original
outlay, the balance that remained was only sufficient
to permit of a low rate of remuneration for the rank
and file. Watchmen had been so miserably underpaid
in the past that the increased wage offered to
the first policemen appeared, when compared with
the old tariff, to be considerable, if hardly dazzling.
As a matter of fact, regard being had to the type of
man required and to the responsibilities thrust upon
him, the salary was far too small, and furthermore
there was so little margin in hand after distribution
that it was financially impossible to set aside any
portion of the general income to form a pension fund
for long and meritorious service. All available cash
had to be devoted to the provision of a weekly wage
to attract a sufficiency of recruits.</p>

<p>The risks that a constable has to face, the long
night work and the constant exposure to all weathers
that are his lot, and which eventually impair even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>the strongest constitutions, make it especially incumbent
on his employers to provide adequately for him
when he is worn out. Quite apart, however, from
this moral obligation (which cannot honourably be
evaded) the existence of a well-conceived and well-administered
superannuation scheme has a most
important bearing on the stability of any police
force&mdash;deferred salary contingently due to his employées
being a most valuable hostage, for the satisfactory
completion of the contract undertaken by them, in
the hands of the paymaster. Moreover if a man has
in prospect a respectable pension on retirement, he is
not tempted improperly to devote himself to the
acquisition of a sum of money for his future maintenance,
nor, of course, has he any inducement to
stay on in the service, blocking the promotion of
those below him, after he is past his work.</p>

<p>At first the percentage of resignations amongst
young constables was extremely high: men of some
few years' service, wearying of a life of discipline, or
finding the duties they had to perform more irksome
than they had anticipated, resigned without hesitation
a position which they had no particular inducement
to retain. This constant leakage was considerably
reduced by the creation of a superannuation fund by
Act of Parliament<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> in 1839, and since that year,
policemen, whatever their grade, have contributed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>some two and a half per cent. of their salaries<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> towards
their retiring pensions. The money raised for
this purpose was so lavishly spent that by 1849 the
fund was insolvent, and seven years later it was
bankrupt. This necessitated further legislation, and
by a Statute passed in 1856<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> authority was obtained
to make good the deficiency out of the rates.
Thenceforward the administration of the fund was
the reverse of generous; and in 1862 it was promulgated
that pensions on the higher scale, for service
of more than fifteen and less than twenty years, were
not to be granted under any circumstances whatever,
and that in order to qualify for the maximum pension
policemen had to serve a full term of twenty-eight
years, notwithstanding the fact that expert
opinion had unanimously declared that twenty-five
years spent in outdoor police work incapacitates the
ordinary man. Irritation at the financial legerdemain
which obscured the true position of the superannuation
fund, and dissatisfaction with the current rates
of pay, caused widespread discontent that culminated
in 1872 in an outbreak of insubordination amongst
the Metropolitan police, many of whom refused to go
on duty until their grievances were redressed. The
ringleaders of what was very nearly a mutiny were
prosecuted, and others less guilty were dismissed the
force; but investigation shewed that the hardships
complained of were none the less real because certain
ill-advised malcontents had adopted a suicidal policy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>in order to gain an immediate hearing. After the
excitement caused by this unfortunate occurrence had
subsided, a compromise was arrived at, removing
some of the more pressing grievances; but it was
only a compromise, and beneath the surface an
undercurrent of justifiable discontent still remained.
In 1881 the Home Secretary (Sir W. Harcourt),
addressing a representative gathering of the Metropolitan
police, said he hoped that at an early period
it would be his grateful office to add to their comfort
and content "by supplying a defect which has
long been felt, in placing on a fixed and satisfactory
footing, not only in London, but throughout the
country, the superannuation and pension of those
who have spent the best days of their lives in the
service of their countrymen."<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>The hopes of the Home Secretary, like those of
the constabulary, were however not yet to be
realised; and it was not until 1890 that anything
like a satisfactory solution of the vexed question of
police superannuation was arrived at. By the
"Police Act,"<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> passed on the 14th of August of that
year, policemen who have completed twenty-five
years approved (<i>i.e.</i> diligent and faithful) service
become entitled, without a medical certificate, to
retire and receive a pension for life, whilst fair provision
is made for those who at any time are certified
as incapacitated for further service. The Act also
defines the conditions under which pensions or
gratuities may be granted to the widows and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>children of deceased officers, deals with the forfeiture
and suspension of pensions, directs how the
fund is to be invested, and, in short, fully propounds
the law which governs the whole field of police
superannuation.</p>

<p>Although the police forces of England are now
in possession of a charter which has enormously improved
their prospects, and in spite of the further
concessions recently granted, it cannot yet be said
that they are well-content with their financial
position; nor is their point of view unreasonable.
They only ask that their work should be estimated
on a present-day valuation, and paid for accordingly;
they naturally object to be underpaid because their
predecessors were half-starved. Moreover, enforced
residence in respectable quarters in some particular
locality where rents may be high, regulations which
debar policemen from earning extra money in their
spare time, and other conditions peculiar to their
calling, unite to form a strong case in favour of a
more generous scale of remuneration being granted
in the future than that considered necessary in the
past.</p>

<p>This is not the place to discuss the precise rate of
wages that a constable should receive, nor to suggest
any scheme by which funds might be raised to meet
increased expenditure under this heading. But it
may be remarked without impropriety, that the more
the public take their share of the police duties which
as good citizens they ought not to shirk, and the
stronger the support, be it moral or physical, that
they extend to their deputies, the less need will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>there be for the maintenance of an ever increasing
army of constables, until the time arrives when, with
a falling police rate, it becomes possible to forget
precedent, and to remunerate our peace officers in
accordance with their deserts.</p>

<p>In 1889 one thousand men were added to the
metropolitan force. There is little doubt that the
expense entailed by this increase might have been
saved if, after the West-End Riots, the public had
been politic enough to back its own side instead of
playing into the hands of its enemies by adding to
the difficulties that the police had to contend with
already. The difficulties referred to arose out of the
following circumstances.</p>

<p>Early in 1886 London was the scene of a sudden
riotous outbreak as serious as it was unexpected.
Remarkable from many points of view, it is especially
to be remembered on account of the utter failure of
the police authorities to cope with it, and especially
to be regretted because it was the first of a series of
incidents which for many months disturbed the
cordial good-will and co-operation between police
and public that had been so carefully built up and
encouraged through many a year.</p>

<p>A meeting having been advertised to take place
in Trafalgar Square on the 8th of February under
the auspices of the London United Workmen's
Committee, the organizers (who were a respectable
body of men desirous only of ventilating their
grievances in a legitimate and orderly manner),
having reason to fear that certain of the Social
Democrats were bent on creating a disturbance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>approached the Chief Commissioner with a request
that the police might assist them in their efforts
to prevent a breach of the peace. Under these
circumstances Sir Edmund Henderson decided to
have a much larger force in reserve than was usual,
and gave orders that whilst only sixty-six constables
were to be detailed for duty in Trafalgar Square
itself, a force of five hundred and sixty-three police
of all ranks was to be held in reserve in the immediate
neighbourhood. As soon as the crowd
began to assemble it was remarked by some of the
most experienced police officers present that a
rougher element than usual predominated, but, on
the whole, the proceedings in the Square were not
of an alarming character, and nothing worse than
inflammatory speeches, accompanied by the usual
horse-play, took place. Shortly before four o'clock
the meeting began to break up, and on this occasion,
contrary to all police experience, which was to the
effect that crowds invariably return by the same
routes that they come by, a compact body some
three thousand strong poured out of the Square, and
started off in a westerly direction. Rapidly traversing
Pall Mall, where several windows were broken,
the mob proceeded up St James' Street and down
Piccadilly, doing considerable damage by the way.
On arriving at Hyde Park, the bulk of the crowd
called a halt and speeches were made, but the
smaller and more lawless section, finding that no
police force offered any resistance to their disorderly
career, continued along S. Audley Street into Oxford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>Street, smashing windows, looting shops, and insulting
all whom they met. Eventually, at about five
o'clock, a small body of police (only sixteen in
number) confronted the mob at the end of Marlborough
Lane, and after several vigorous charges,
succeeded in dispersing the rioters.</p>

<p>It may well be asked how it came about that for
the space of an hour a gang of roughs, which in the
end was so easily disposed of, was permitted to riot
with impunity through some of the richest thoroughfares
of London, in defiance of the considerable force
of constables on duty, and in spite of the fact that
two regiments of cavalry were within ten minutes ride
of the scene. The only possible explanation is to be
found in the lamentable want of foresight exhibited
on this occasion by the authorities responsible for
the police arrangements, combined with the singular
lack of initiative and resource shewn by the subordinate
officers throughout the day. A cursory
glance at the conditions prevailing in Trafalgar
Square reveals in a moment the reasons for the
defeat of the police; it is at once apparent that their
failure must not be attributed to any physical cause
whatever. The police force on duty was quite large
enough, and the units of which it was composed were
sufficiently well endowed with muscle, nerve and
morale, to have kept in order a crowd twice as
violent and many times more numerous than the one
actually opposed to it; the collapse of authority was
due to defects of organization, to bad strategy, and
to tactical blundering. If a small body of mounted
police had been present&mdash;if scouts had been instructed
to watch the outskirts of the crowd to ascertain and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>report upon the routes of dispersal&mdash;if the officer in
command had taken up a prominent position known
beforehand to his subordinates&mdash;if a system of
circulating information rapidly and with accuracy
had been adopted&mdash;if a single one of these obvious
precautions had been taken, the West End Riots
would not have occurred, and the crop of difficulties
which blocked the path of the Metropolitan Police
during the next two years would have been avoided.</p>

<p>On the 9th February another assemblage of roughs
took place in Trafalgar Square, and fears that further
riots would ensue took possession of the West End;
but the police were equal to the emergency, and the
meeting was dispersed without difficulty. Wednesday
the 10th, however, was a day of serious apprehension;
London was wrapped in a dense black fog,
and the rumour gained credence that 50,000 desperate
men from the riverside suburbs were concentrating
prior to an organized attempt to loot the capital.
The Bank of England retained its military guard;
the Bond Street jewellers and other shopkeepers
suspended business and barricaded their windows.
Half London waited in hourly expectancy of hearing
the shouts of the attacking columns through the
fog.</p>

<p>It was clearly the business of the police authorities
to satisfy themselves as to the truth or falsity of
these rumours, and in the latter case to do all in
their power to restore confidence. The course they
actually pursued was to send out notices broadcast
advising householders to take all precautions necessary
for their own safety. This action of the authorities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>only served to heighten the general alarm, people
naturally assuming that it amounted to an official
confirmation of the sensational stories that were
everywhere current. The state of uncertainty and
alarm continued through the night, but when, on the
following morning, it became known that the whole
story had had no foundation in fact, all the various
emotions of the past three days gave place to
a unanimous feeling of indignation against the
police.</p>

<p>The value of the property destroyed and stolen
by the mob, whilst the machinery for keeping the
peace was thus temporarily out of gear, was comparatively
trivial, and probably fell short of the
£7000 paid as compensation; a far more serious
factor was the loss of prestige that befell the police.
The importance of the Trafalgar Square riots of '86
depends, not so much upon the damage done to
Club-house windows and tradesmen's shop-fronts, as
upon the fact that this was the first occasion since
the institution of the modern police that the mob had
succeeded in getting the upper hand of any considerable
body of constables. Regrettable incidents
had occurred in many of the tussles that had taken
place since the first conflict at Coldbath Fields in
'33; but on every occasion victory had in the end
decisively rested with the peace officers, so that it
came to be generally believed that it was useless
to resist them. This was the very lesson that the
chiefs of the police had been at such pains to impress
upon the disorderly section of the public ever since
the commencement of the new establishment; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>the success they had achieved in this direction had
proved greatly to the advantage of the rate-payers,
who had to support, in consequence, a much smaller
force than would otherwise have been necessary.
The policeman managing a hostile crowd, or keeping
order in a slum peopled by thieves, is in much the
same position as a solitary European holding his
own amongst a swarm of Asiatics. Take away his
prestige, and that same moment he ceases to be an
object of respect, and becomes an object of contempt.
The rough and the criminal do not fear the prowess
of the individual policeman, they fear the organization
behind him&mdash;take that away, and the constable
becomes merely a big man armed with nothing more
formidable than a wooden truncheon.</p>

<p>The result of this temporary and partial breakdown
of the organization was that the whole force
suffered a double loss; the general public, no longer
feeling the old confidence in the power of the police
to protect them, withheld to some extent their moral
support; whilst the criminal public, assuring themselves
that their old belief in the invincibility of the
police was groundless, began to threaten where they
used to cringe.</p>

<p>It was providential that the enemies of order and
good government failed to take full advantage of a
moment so auspicious for their designs. The weak
places of the defence were exposed for an instant,
but the breaches were rapidly repaired and strengthened:
in allowing this opportunity to pass, the
anarchists and revolutionists, who as a rule are
not slow to advertise their existence, missed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>chance that is not likely to be offered a second
time.</p>

<p>A good deal of inflammatory language was
indulged in, but the attacks were ill-timed and
unimportant. A large meeting of Socialists, followed
by riotous proceedings, took place at Birmingham;
but any serious consequences that might
have resulted, were averted by a timely display
of strength. London was allowed time to recover
itself, and it was not until the 21st of February
that a mass meeting held in Hyde Park, and
attended by some 50,000 people, gave cause for
alarm. Fortunately the dangerous classes were not
conspicuously represented, and the violently disposed
minority was effectually controlled by the
police, who, smarting perhaps, under their recent
reverse, handled the crowd with some roughness.
A week later, rioting of a more serious character
broke out in Manchester, to be repeated on a larger
scale on March 18th; the local police, however,
supported by soldiers, were successful in their efforts
to restore order on both occasions.</p>

<p>At the time of the West End riots Parliament
was not sitting, and the public indignation found
expression in the columns of the newspapers, where
a vigorous campaign was commenced, directed partly
against the Home Office, and partly against the
police authorities. This chorus of irresponsible criticism
was to some extent silenced by the prompt
action of the Home Secretary (Mr Childers), who
immediately appointed a committee, on which he
himself sat as chairman, to investigate the conduct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>of the police. The report, which was issued on
the 22nd of Feb. '86, impartially reviewed all
the circumstances of the case, and pointed out the
mistakes that had been made in the police arrangements.
The committee found, amongst other defects,
that the chain of responsibility in the force was very
imperfect, and called attention to the remarkable
fact that, although Standing Police Orders to regulate
the conduct of constables at peaceable public
meetings had long been issued, no regulations for
the management of unruly mobs had ever been
published. The report, (upon the authority of
which the foregoing remarks on the Trafalgar
Square arrangements are based) concluded with a
strong expression of opinion as to the desirability
of investigating without delay the administration
and organization of the Metropolitan Police Force,
and the Home Secretary promised to give immediate
effect to the recommendations of the Committee
by instituting an exhaustive inquiry into
the question, with a view to making the necessary
changes.</p>

<p>The resignation of Sir Edmund Henderson, which
took place on the 20th of February, was perhaps
inevitable under the circumstances; but much regret
was felt and expressed throughout the force when it
became known that the Chief, who for seventeen
years had watched over the security of London,
and under whose rule the police had earned a high
reputation for efficiency, was about to leave Scotland
Yard.</p>

<p>During his tenure of office the peace had been so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>well maintained, and the police mechanism had
worked so smoothly, that his experience had
taught him to under-estimate the dangers that
lurk below the surface in all large crowds, and to
over-estimate the preparedness of the men under
his command to deal with any possible outbreak.
As he knew them, London crowds were well
behaved, and London police were equal to any
emergency.</p>

<p>The place vacated by the resignation of Sir
Edmund Henderson was offered to Sir Charles
Warren, a well-known officer of Engineers, whose
talent for administration had been proved in
Bechuanaland and elsewhere, and who now relinquished
the Governorship of the Red Sea
Littoral to take up the Chief Commissionership
of the Metropolitan Police. The task
entrusted to the new chief was definite if not
easy. Before all things he had to restore the
prestige which had suffered so severely on the
day when the mob gained the upper hand, and
he had to demonstrate, cost what it might,
that the police could not again be defied with
impunity.</p>

<p>After the occurrences of February 1886, there was
a truce lasting some eighteen months during which
the peace was successfully maintained in spite of the
persistent hostility evinced by a large section of the
public. But in the autumn of 1887, disorderly
assemblages of the unemployed, led by demagogues,
encouraged by foolish agitators, and reinforced with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>the scum of London, became so frequent and intolerable,<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
that Sir Charles Warren had to make a
bold move in the interests of order, by altogether
forbidding the use of Trafalgar Square as a place of
public meeting. His action was endorsed by the
Secretary of State, but only in such a half-hearted
fashion that the forces of disorder, confident that
they were the masters of the situation, determined
to fight it out. Accordingly both parties prepared
for battle. On the one side some six or seven
thousand special constables were sworn in, and a
large military force was held in reserve; on the
other, defiance was openly preached, and adherents
were canvassed. When on Sunday the 13th of
November the mob began to assemble, they found
that the Square and its approaches were already
held; but, undeterred by the force opposed to them,
and in no mood to return quietly to their homes,
the ring-leaders, after a short parley, tried to break
through the police cordon. In the course of the
protracted struggle which ensued, several minor
casualties occurred on either side, and although the
crowd resolutely returned to the attack time after
time, in the end the police were successful all along
the line; the square was cleared without loss of life
or injury to property, and the ability of the police
to carry out the orders of the Government was
satisfactorily demonstrated. Subsequently other
attempts were made to reopen the question; but
the result was the same. The next phase was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>the repetition of the familiar and easily disproved
charges as to the alleged violence of the constables,
many persons, who had attacked the police for their
failure in 1886, now joining in the chorus anathematising
their successes of the following year.</p>

<p>The entire responsibility for the instructions upon
which the police had acted, belonged, of course, to
the Government; and on the reopening of Parliament
the focus of the agitation was transferred to
Westminster, where the whole question as to the legal
power of constabulary forces to prevent open-air
meetings was debated at some length. In demanding
an enquiry into the right of public meeting, Sir
Charles Russell insisted that such a right existed by
virtue of long-sanctioned custom, and contended
that the Executive was not justified in vetoing any
assembly that was not of itself illegal. The Home
Secretary replied regretting the events of "Bloody
Sunday," which he described as lamentable and
distressing, but he denied that any right of public
meeting, as such, was recognised by English law, and
concluded by saying that "this series of meetings
had exhausted the police, terrified the public, and
made the veto necessary." Sir Henry James held
that, whilst the purely legal side of the question was
comparatively immaterial, the maintenance of the
peace and considerations of the public safety were
all-important; and urged that it was the duty of
Government to employ such police measures as
might be found necessary to prevent the undoubted
liberties of the many from being interfered with by
the intolerable whims of the few, even if the latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>happened to be legally within their rights.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> The
common-sense point of view enunciated by Sir
Henry James found general acceptance, both in the
House of Commons and throughout the country;
Sir Charles Russell's motion was rejected, and the
public began to rally to the support of the police.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>From the time when Rural Constabulary forces
were instituted in 1839, until the date of the
creation of County Councils fifty years later, the police
authority throughout rural England had been the
County Justices of the Peace in Quarter Sessions, to
which body alone, in the several counties, was each
Chief-Constable answerable, provided that he conformed
to the general regulations laid down by the
Secretary of State. During this period various
changes, in addition to those of a more important
nature already mentioned, were brought about, having
for their object the better management of the
police, or the more convenient administration of justice.
In 1846 County Courts for the hearing of civil suits
involving minor issues were established in the different
shires; and, by the gradual enlargement of the jurisdiction
exercised by these tribunals, the higher courts
have, to a corresponding extent, been relieved of much
petty business to the advantage of larger interests.
In 1869 the office of High-Constable was formally
abolished, any powers that he had anciently exercised
having long since dwindled almost to the vanishing
point. At first the Treasury contribution towards
the expenses of the rural police had been strictly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>limited and quite inadequate in amount; but in
1875 the old limitation was suspended, first for
one year, then for another, and finally indefinitely,
until it became the rule for the public Treasury to
provide half the cost for pay and clothing of all
provincial police forces that, at the end of each year,
are returned as efficient by the Home Office on the
recommendation of the Government Inspector of
Constabulary.</p>

<p>Following upon the Municipal Corporations Act
of 1835,<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> some fifty Acts of Parliament, relating
wholly or in part to municipal government, received
the royal assent, and this at the rate of more than
one a year; in August 1882 the mass of legislative
amendments that resulted was consolidated and reduced
to one Statute.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Amongst other police enactments,
the formation of a separate constabulary,
distinct from the county force, in any borough containing
less than twenty thousand inhabitants, was
hereby prohibited; but the control of local police
forces already established was for the present confirmed
to the existing Watch Committees, whatever
might be the population of the borough concerned,
and at the same time authority to enforce certain
sanitary laws (<i>e.g.</i> The Public Health Acts of 1873
and 1875) was conferred on the Town Councils.</p>

<p>Six years later more important changes, affecting
the police of counties as well as that of boroughs,
were introduced by the Local Government Act of
1888,<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> which transferred the control of the rural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>police from the Justices of the Peace in Quarter
Sessions to an annually appointed committee (called
the Standing Joint Committee) composed of a certain
number of County Councillors, selected by and
from the members of the new councils, and of an
equal number of Justices chosen by Quarter Sessions.
The effect of this Statute was not simply to substitute
one consultative body for another, for to the
Standing Joint Committee was also conveyed all
that authority over the county police which had
hitherto been enjoyed by Justices out of Session,
the important proviso being added, however, that
"nothing in this Act shall affect the powers, duties,
and liabilities of Justices as Conservators of the
Peace, or the obligation of the Chief Constable or
other Constables to obey their lawful orders given in
that behalf."<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>Although local government in township, hundred
and shire is as old as the Constitution itself, the
birthday of the modern county councils in 1888 is
from the historian's point of view an event of the
first importance, for it deprived the county magistracy
of a prerogative which for more than five hundred
years had been steadily growing in completeness, by
suddenly transferring the destinies of the rural police
to a body that owed the half of its authority to the
popular vote of the shire. From the standpoint of
the practical politician, on the other hand, the change
has so far proved but an incident; and, for all the
effect it has produced on the actual efficiency and
on the daily routine of the police forces concerned, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>has passed almost unnoticed. Standing Joint Committees
have accepted and carried on the traditions
which they inherited; and the administration of the
county police remains much the same to-day as it
was when the entire control was vested in the county
magistrates, who, no longer overweighted by a mass
of general&mdash;as distinguished from judicial&mdash;business,
are now free to devote themselves to their proper
duties as conservators of the peace.</p>

<p>By the first Municipal Corporations Act, any
borough so disposed was allowed a separate police
force on the understanding that, in the case of
towns containing less than five thousand inhabitants,
all expense connected with the maintenance of such
forces should be borne by the borough availing itself
of the privilege. In 1888, this power of choice was
restricted, and all boroughs, which at the last census
failed to show a population of 10,000, were amalgamated
for police purposes with the county to
which they belonged; if, however, any borough
entitled to have its own police prefers amalgamation,
it is permitted to contract with the Standing
Joint Committee of the county in which it is
situated for the establishment of a consolidated
constabulary under the general disposition and
government of the Chief Constable of that county,
the powers of the Watch Committee remaining in
abeyance as long as the contract lasts. A larger
measure of autonomy was secured by the Local
Government Act to certain boroughs, called County-Boroughs,
being those which were either counties
in themselves before the passing of the Act, or had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>an estimated population of at least 50,000 on the
1st of June 1888. As, however, the police of a
County-Borough is for all practical purposes on the
same basis as one maintained by any other town,
that controls a separate constabulary, it is unnecessary
further to enlarge upon this part of the
subject. It is sufficient to state that in 1899 one
hundred and twenty-four English and Welsh
boroughs possessed independent police forces, and
that out of this number sixty-one were county-boroughs.</p>

<p>At the present time there are only two portions
of the United Kingdom that do not manage their
own police. Ireland is one and London is the other.
Ireland is not allowed the privilege for reasons with
which we are not here concerned, but which have
been succinctly put by a politician who is not ill-disposed
towards that country, "If Kerry was
treated as Northumberland," said he, "Kerry must
control her police, and if Kerry controlled her police,
there was an end of law and order."<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> The case
of London is altogether different: when the Local
Government Act readjusted the command exercised
by the various local authorities over their county
and borough police forces, the Metropolitan area was
especially exempted from provisions that applied
elsewhere. A County of London, carved out of
the counties of Middlesex, Surrey and Kent, was
called into being on the 1st of January 1889, but
its area did not coincide with the Metropolitan
Police District, nor was the London County Council
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>given any voice in the management of London's
constabulary.</p>

<p>This anomalous position of the Metropolitan
Police, governed as it is by a Chief Commissioner
appointed by the Home Office and independent of
municipal control, has ever since been a subject for
controversy amongst local politicians. Members of
the progressive party have held that the control of
the police ought to be transferred from the Government
to the London County Council; and, in support
of the desired change, argue that as the ratepayers
find the money they should have a voice in its
expenditure; they contend that it is an insult to
London that she alone amongst the great towns
of England is debarred from the management of
her own constabulary. At first sight it would
appear reasonable to extend to London the same
measure of self-government in police matters that
provincial towns enjoy; but the answer of those who
are content with the present arrangement is that
the Metropolitan Police is an Imperial rather than
a local force&mdash;provincial towns and districts have
only provincial interests to guard, London has
responsibilities as wide as the Empire; and however
public-spirited local authorities may be, the
danger will always remain that they may be induced
to prefer local to national interests. The
Houses of Parliament, the British Museum, public
offices and foreign embassies happen to be in
London, but they are not local institutions: the
head-quarters of the Criminal Investigation Department
is no more inseparable from Scotland Yard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>than is parliament from Westminster: London is
the focus of crime and it is convenient that it
should also be the head-quarters of the machinery
for its prevention, but that is no reason why the
principal detective agency of England should be
subordinated to Spring Gardens influences. The
inhabitants of Canterbury might as well aspire to
the control of the National Church on the strength
of their pride of See, as Londoners insist that the
Metropolis must bear the responsibilities of the
National Police. It is repeated that the ratepayers
of London pay for the Metropolitan force;
but this is only partly true. It would be more
correct to say that they pay half the bill, and, in
return, they obtain the protection they pay for, the
Imperial Treasury providing the balance.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested that a fair compromise
might be found in a division of the responsibility,
by giving the London County Council control over
a moiety of the force for local purposes, and transferring
to that body the authority to license hackney-carriages,
pedlars and lodging houses together with
the management of street traffic, &amp;c., &amp;c., whilst
retaining a separate police establishment for imperial
purposes; but there is little doubt that such
a change would only lead to friction, and might conceivably
bring about a recrudescence of that jealousy
which was the bane of the old parochial system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole question is complicated by the independent
position that the City of London has been
allowed to retain. From many points of view it
would be advantageous to concentrate the entire
police of the metropolis under one and the same
administration, and to some amalgamation seems
desirable for the sake of uniformity, if for no better
reason; but regularity in our institutions is not in
itself a great end to strive for, and it would be
prodigal of labour to tinker with our going concerns
merely to eliminate deviations from the
normal. Against amalgamation much can be urged.
The city wishes to retain its ancient privilege of
policing itself, and as long as it maintains an
efficient force entirely at its own expense, the
government is not likely to interfere. The matter
is largely one of finance. Under the existing
arrangements, three-quarters of the total cost of
the City police is raised in the city by a local
police rate, and the remaining quarter is subscribed
by the Corporation out of its revenue; if, however,
the control was transferred to the Chief Commissioner
of the Metropolitan Police, the city would
only have to pay five-ninths of the total cost instead
of the whole amount as at present&mdash;or putting it
in another light, amalgamation would cost the
Imperial Treasury more than fifty thousand pounds
a year, which sum is the price that the city now
pays for the privilege of managing its own police.
A second objection to amalgamation is that the
Justice Rooms at Mansion House and Guildhall
are presided over by magistrates who are experts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>in commercial jurisdiction, and consequently the
usefulness of these courts would be to some extent
impaired if they became ordinary metropolitan
police courts.</p>

<p>Modern police in the City of London dates from
1839, in which year, it will be remembered, the
Corporation awoke to the necessity of reorganization,
and so escaped the consolidating process that had
already absorbed all the other independent and semi-independent
police establishments within the 688
square miles that surround Charing Cross. Since
then the advisability of fusing together the two
London police forces has often been debated, and
after the death of Sir Richard Mayne in 1869
the threatened amalgamation would have become a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i> had the Government been ready to
acquiesce in the suggestion made by the Corporation
that the City Commissioner should be promoted
to the command of the proposed combination. In
1894 the Royal Commission on the Unification of
London reported in favour of bringing the whole of
the police of the metropolis under one administration;
but its advice has not yet been acted upon, nor is
there any immediate prospect of its recommendations
being carried into effect. If, however, the City
authorities should at any time fail to keep up the
high standard of police that they have hitherto
maintained they would certainly lose their historic
privilege of police independence, and the knowledge
of this fact contributes to the undoubted efficiency
of the force they control. At the present day both
the metropolitan and city forces rightly consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>themselves <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d'elite</i>, and a proper rivalry exists
between them, which is at once creditable in itself
and advantageous to the public interest. We have
said that the ultimate authority over the city police
rests with the Corporation. It may however be
remarked that the appointment of any person has
to be ratified by the Crown before he is confirmed in
the Commissionership, and that practically speaking
the powers possessed by the Corporation are exercised
by proxy. To a Police Committee consisting
of some eighty members selected by the Common
Council is delegated everything that concerns the
pay, allowances, and financial business of the force;
whilst all questions touching the discipline and disposal
of the men under his command are referred to
the Commissioner, who is thus supreme in his own
department.</p>

<p>One of the clauses in Peel's Act had disfranchised
the new police by denying to constables the right to
vote for the election of a Member of Parliament for
the district comprised in the metropolitan police
area: with the growth of other forces this disability
was correspondingly extended, and all over the
country policemen were debarred from taking their
part in parliamentary elections. For the moment
the prohibition was in all probability a wise one;
elections were then very turbulent affairs, public
opinion was already aflame with excitement over the
impending parliamentary reforms, and men could
only speculate upon the future behaviour of the
as-yet-untried constabulary. Even if it had been
possible to guarantee that the police would maintain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>a perfectly correct attitude, prudence would still
have counselled the advisability of dissociating the
guardians of the peace from the factious interests of
electioneering. The public were so suspicious, and
Peel's scheme had so many opponents, that in every
political contest the losers would to a certainty have
attributed the result to the sinister influence of the
bogey-man in blue. When, however, both popular
prejudice and popular excitement had subsided, there
was no longer sufficient cause for the disfranchisement
of a numerous and important class of public
servants who had proved themselves worthy of all
trust; but the original prohibition still held good, to
the great disadvantage of the police service. This
continued for nearly half a century, that is until
1887, when the "Police Disabilities Removal Act"
of that year for the first time gave the parliamentary
suffrage to all properly qualified police officers who
comply with certain regulations made for the joint
convenience of police and public.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Six years later
constables became entitled to vote, if qualified, at
School Board, Municipal and other elections; but
in no case are they allowed to canvass, any attempt
to influence an elector rendering the offender liable
to a penalty of £10.</p>

<p>The wisdom of enfranchising the police has been
amply proved by the result, for on no occasion since
their admission to the suffrage has it been as much
as suggested that they make an improper use of
the privilege. Although English police of the
twentieth century is a very different thing from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>Anglo-Saxon police of the tenth century, there is a
potent characteristic which is common to both; that
is to say, the modern system rests, as the ancient
one did, on the sure foundation of mutual reliance.
We may rely upon it that the law-abiding character
of the British nation is largely due to the rarity
with which espionage as a method of control has
been employed in these islands, just as the trustworthiness
of our English Constabularies is largely
the outcome of the confidence that we repose in
the wisdom and integrity of our peace-officers. We
are well served by our police because we have wisely
made them personally responsible for their actions.
The constable suffers equally with the non-official
citizen for any illegal action he may commit; the
law protects him only in the performance of acts
authorized by the law; nor can he divest himself of
responsibility by pleading the orders of his superior
officer, if those orders should chance to be illegal.
This personal responsibility is not only a curb to
excessive zeal, it is also a spur to legitimate activity.
"When," says Sir Arthur Helps, "a man can do
anything well, and is entrusted to do it, he has
generally an impulse to action which is as strong
and abiding as can be found amongst human motives,
and which will even surpass the love of gain."</p>

<p>To teach the value of self-reliance is one of the
most important duties that a Chief-Constable has to
perform, and the efficiency of the force under his
command will largely depend upon the manner in
which he has imbued individual constables with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>lesson. To this end the military model of organization
and discipline must not be too closely followed;
soldiers generally act in masses and but rarely on
their own responsibility, whilst policemen do nine-tenths
of their work as individuals. The main
object of discipline in the army is to make a man
obey orders from force of habit on occasions when
his natural instinct would impel him to think only
of his personal safety, advantage, or honour; the
principal end to be attained in the education of the
constable is that he should know his duty, and do it
with circumspection and self-control, generally on
his own initiative and frequently in opposition to
the sympathies of the crowd.</p>

<p>Police discipline has been described by Sir
Howard Vincent as "the obedience and respect
to lawful authority which distinguishes an organized
body from a rabble"<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and Sir Henry Hawkins
(Lord Brampton) has insisted upon the necessity of
absolute obedience being rendered by constables to
all in authority over them, "Such obedience and
observance," he said, "I regard as essential to the
existence of a police force."<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> All who have had
any experience of dealing with large bodies of men
will endorse every word of these pronouncements.
First obey orders and, if necessary, complain afterwards,
is a rule upon the application of which
depends the life and well-being of every properly-disciplined
body; at the same time it should not be
forgotten that the too-strict enforcement of a rigid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>type of discipline neither conduces to the value of
a police force nor to the advantage of the public.
Periodically since 1829 alarmists have repeated the
formula that "the era of dragooning has dawned";
on every occasion hitherto the cry has proved as
groundless as that of the proverbial shepherd-boy,
but, in order to make quite sure that the fable shall
for us have no actual counterpart, it is politic to
remember that a watchdog which is not kept under
proper control may become as dangerous as any wolf.
In Continental Europe this danger has not, as we
think, been sufficiently guarded against: the police
functionary is there entrusted with powers that
render him to some extent independent of the
ordinary law of the land, for he cannot be prosecuted
for malfeasance unless special permission has
first been obtained from the Government, and this
permission is only granted under very exceptional
circumstances.</p>

<p>Occasion has already been taken to remark that
the freedom enjoyed by the Press of this country is
an invaluable safeguard against police tyranny, that
the public Press in fact polices the constabulary.
This, however, is only one of the many police functions
that modern journalism performs. When a serious
crime is committed the newspapers raise a Hue and
Cry so far-reaching and persistent that soon every
tavern discusses the news, every village harbours a
potential detective. Whenever a criminal is caught
and convicted the deterrent value of the punishment
served out to him is increased a thousand-fold by the
publicity given by the Press to the award of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>judge. In former days capital punishment was
publicly inflicted with the mistaken idea that in this
way was the maximum deterrent effect of the death
penalty assured<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>; now, not only is what was a
brutalizing spectacle decently veiled from the public
gaze, but in place of the depraved thousands who
formerly used to witness the "turning off" of each
poor wretch, normal millions read, and it is to be
hoped inwardly digest, the lesson that these tragedies
are meant to convey. The Press also acts most
effectually as a modern substitute for the pillory.
The knowledge that an account of his offence will
figure in the morning's police intelligence for all his
friends to read, is far more likely to prevent a man
(who lays claim to even a shred of respectability)
from committing himself, than is any fine that the
police magistrate might impose. Nor is the efficacy
of the Press as an auxiliary agent of police confined
to its success as a deterrent&mdash;newspapers advertise
the bankrupt's loss of credit, expose the tricks of the
swindler, ruin the trade of the impostor, and chastise
many an offender whom the law cannot reach.
Finally, a free Press, being a guarantee for public
liberty, acts as a seton for the escape of evil humours
which, if confined, might become a source of danger
to the Commonwealth; for as Bentham has said, "a
people sure of its rights, enjoys them with moderation
and tranquillity."<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>In his introduction to the "Criminal Statistics for
1898," recently published by the Home Office, Mr
C. E. Troup, of that Department, says that the
general conclusions to be drawn from a study of the
comparative tables which form part of the statistical
returns, may be summed up as follows&mdash;"That the
actual number of crimes brought into the courts has
diminished appreciably during the last thirty years;
that, if the increase of population is taken into
account, the decrease in crime becomes very marked;
that, if we also take into account the increase of the
police forces and the greater efficiency in the means
of investigating and punishing crime, we may conclude
that the decrease in crime is even greater than
the figures shew; and finally, if we take into account
the fact that habitual criminals are now for the
most part imprisoned only for short periods and
have much more frequent opportunities than formerly
of committing offences, we must hold that the
number of criminals has diminished in an even
greater ratio than the number of crimes."<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>It is of course impossible to estimate with any
degree of accuracy to what extent this diminution of
crime and this increased security of recent years are
due to the exertions of our modern constabularies;
enough has been said to make it abundantly clear
that the amelioration is real, and that it is progressive
in its tendency, but the difficulty is to apportion
the credit justly between the various agencies that
have contributed to the result. There is no doubt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>that the spread of education and the labours of
religious and philanthropic bodies have done much
to civilise the masses; it is certain also that an
improved prison system and a reformed penal code
have reacted beneficially on the criminal classes;
but if we believe in the teachings of history we shall
put our trust in no combination of influences directed
towards the maintenance of the peace that does not
at least include a good preventive police-force. If
Lombroso's theories are correct, even if some men
are born criminal beyond all hope of human redemption,
these are only reasons for redoubling our police
precautions: the delinquent who is a delinquent
from his cradle is the more dangerous on that
account, and to the congenital criminal must be
denied the opportunity for mischief. But such
freaks are rare and the normal criminal is anything
but a creature of impulse; his calculations may not be
shrewd but they are undoubtedly deliberate. "Abandon
fait larron!" When poverty or the want of life's
necessaries lead to theft, or where native cruelty and
love of bloodshed give rise to deeds of violence,
police, however efficient, can effect but little in the
way of prevention; but it is the almost unanimous
opinion of those best qualified to judge that the
bulk of the offences committed in this country are
perpetrated by those who enter upon a criminal
career because it appears to them that it is easy and
profitable, and because they think that it will enable
them to obtain luxuries that lie beyond the reach of
their industrious and honest companions. It is
obvious, therefore, that an effective police, by making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>the profession of dishonesty difficult and precarious,
can remove the principal incentive that makes men
criminal.</p>

<p>The circle of police employment is constantly
widening, and many of the functions delegated to
the Constabulary by Parliament and by local authorities
have not been so much as touched upon in
this book, which, in a small compass, has endeavoured
to trace the main features of police development in
England through a great number of years. It is to
be hoped, however, that the tendency to load police
officers with duties heavier and more diverse than
they have to perform already will not go on increasing.
It is difficult to fix the precise limits within
which it is proper that they should act; but it is certain
that by indefinitely multiplying their duties we
run a twofold risk, viz., that of rendering the work of
police constables so complex and varied that men of
average talent and education will be unable to perform
it thoroughly, and further of undermining the
popularity of the force by exhibiting its members
before the eyes of the people as universally interfering
and censorious. It is, of course, right and proper
that the policeman should endeavour to prevent the
commission of any act that he knows to be illegal, at
all times and in all places; but it is generally advisable
to employ functionaries who do not belong to
the police for purposes not closely connected with
the maintenance of the peace, whenever the employment
of outsiders is equally effectual: it is more
convenient, for instance, that game-keepers should
protect the rights of owners on sporting estates, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>that custom-house officials should examine portmanteaux,
than that such duties should be performed
by constables. His Majesty's Coastguard, the Inspectors
of Mines and Factories, and other persons
appointed by Societies for the prevention of cruelty
to animals, and for the suppression of mendicity, etc.,
relieve the police of much work by carrying out the
various parts assigned to them by Government or by
private enterprise; it is worth considering whether
it would not be more profitable to delegate to functionaries,
other than constables; all duties connected
with the inspection of weights and measures, the enforcement
of sanitary laws, the protection of arsenals
and dockyards, and with the maintenance of order
on racecourses. A force specially devoted to the
last mentioned object is desirable on many grounds.
In the first place the knowledge that such a body
would possess of the welshers, cardsharpers, and pickpockets
who travel about from one race-meeting to
another, and with whom the different local police
forces are unable to cope, would put an end to a
great deal of the crime which is at present unchecked
and undetected; and in the second place, it would no
longer be necessary to withdraw large bodies of
police from their proper duties for the protection of
race-goers. On the occasion of the riot at Featherstone
in 1893, the calling out of the Military, and
the loss of life which followed, was largely attributable
to the concentration at Doncaster of all the
available Yorkshire constables, an unfortunate
arrangement which bared the rest of the county of
its regular protectors, and encouraged the rioters to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>proceed to lengths they would not otherwise have
attempted.</p>

<p>Although it will hardly be denied that our police
discharge their office conscientiously, courteously and
courageously, the general public has shewn itself
somewhat slow to acknowledge the debt which it
owes to the men who undertake what is by common
consent a thankless task; who armed with no extraordinary
powers, and protected by no elaborate
exemptions, perform arduous duties on behalf of
their fellow-countrymen, for little reward, and at
considerable personal risk. Perhaps it may not be
presumptuous to hope that the foregoing pages, by
adding their quota to the scanty sources of information
on the subject, may cause a corresponding
increase in the tribute of public goodwill, that has
been so well earned, and so long awaited, by the
police forces of England.</p>

of class legislation ever known to the English Constitution&mdash;it was a
deliberate violation of the rights of the many for the gratification of
the few&mdash;the same act which was venial in the gentleman became unpardonable
when committed by the villein. For example, a common
man who slew a deer was guilty of felony and might be capitally convicted,
whereas a nobleman riding through the King's Forest was
allowed to kill a stag or two for his refreshment, on the understanding
that he did so in the sight of a ranger, or if no ranger was present,
provided that someone blew a horn for him, "that he seem not to
steal the deer" (9 Henry III.).</p></div>

44, which enacts that action cannot be brought against a constable for
anything done by him in obedience to a Justice's warrant, unless the
Justice who signed the warrant is made a joint-defendant with the constable;
and which directs that if action is brought jointly against the
Justice and the constable, then the jury shall find for the latter, provided
that they are satisfied that he acted strictly in accordance with
the terms of the warrant that he pleads in justification. When making
an arrest a constable should, if required, shew the warrant which is his
authority, but he need not allow it to leave his hand.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_158" id="Footnote_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_158"><span class="label">[158]</span></a> By 29 Car. ii. c. 7, § 7 it was enacted that no liability attached to
the Hundred if a man be robbed whilst travelling on a Sunday&mdash;"for
he should not travel on the Lord's Day, nor ought the Hundred to
watch on that day of rest." Nevertheless it was ordained that Hue
and Cry should be raised against a known offender, despite the non-liability
of the Hundred, in order that depredators should not take
advantage of the omission.
</p>
<p>
Actions against the Hundred had to be brought within three months
from the date of the damage, and there was no liability for deeds done
in the night-time&mdash;if, however, there was just sufficient light to see a
man's face, liability might be proved, whatever the hour. No charge
against the Hundred held good for any robbery done in a man's house,
"because every man's house is his castle, which he ought to defend;
and if any one be robbed in his house it shall be esteemed his own
fault" (Dalton, c. 84); and with regard to liability on account of
murder and robbery committed in the daytime, see "Year Book of the
Exchequer," (16 Edward I.)</p></div>

six coercive measures generally known as the "Six Acts" were rushed
through both Houses of Parliament in a special autumn session of 1819.
These Acts sought to preserve the peace by placing restrictions on the
press, by forbidding the training of unauthorized persons in the use of
arms, by empowering Justices of the Peace to search for and confiscate
weapons, and by other repressive measures of a similar nature.</p></div>

Sessions, which hitherto had been competent to deal with all offences
except treason, was limited by 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 38, which removes murder,
capital felony and some other offences from the cognizance of the
Justices. In the metropolis, at the same time, much criminal business
was transferred from Justices of the Peace to Stipendiary Magistrates.
This was due rather to the increase of commitments consequent upon
an improved police, than to any implied incompetence of the Courts.
In 1896 Quarter Sessions were again empowered to try Burglary cases
(59 &amp; 60 Vict. c. 57), and a further extension, or rather restoration, of
the powers exercised by Justices in Quarter Sessions is understood to
be now (1901) under consideration.</p></div>
